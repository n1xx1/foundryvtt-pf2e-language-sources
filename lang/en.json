Only a group with shields can use this formation. <strong>Benefit</strong> The troop gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against ranged attacks and to Reflex saves. <strong>Drawback</strong> The troop takes a –10-foot penalty to all its Speeds.</li><li><strong>Wedge</strong> The troop aligns itself behind a powerful commander. <strong>Benefit</strong> The troop chooses an adjacent allied creature without the troop trait to fall in behind. Each time the chosen creature Strides, the troop follows as a free action, Striding to keep the chosen creature adjacent. <strong>Drawback</strong> The troop loses some of their autonomy. They're slowed 1 and can't voluntarily move away from their leader.</li></ul>",
          "ChangeShape": "<p>The monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.AJstokjdG6iDjVjE]{Impersonate} use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block.</p>",
          "ConstantSpells": "<p>A constant spell affects the monster without the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited. If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions the spell requires.</p>",

Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC.</p>",
          "Coven": "<p>This monster can form a coven with two or more other creatures who also have the coven ability. This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony with all prospective coven members. After the coven is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments, adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.</p>\n<p>Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single action that has the concentrate trait. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens grant the 8th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.dN8QBNuTiaBHCKUe]{Cursed Metamorphosis} spell and all the following spells, which the coven can cast at any rank up to 5th: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.41TZEjhO6D1nWw2X]{Augury}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6]{Charm}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.HXhWYJviWalN5tQ2]{Clairaudience}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.zvKWclOZ7A53DObE]{Clairvoyance}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.yM3KTTSAIHhyuP14]{Dream Message}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ucf8eynbZMfUucjE]{Illusory Scene}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ek5XI0aEdZhBgm21]{Scouting Eye}, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.FM3SmEW8N1FCRjqt]{Talking Corpse}. Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven can also cast the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XkDCzMIyc0YOjw05]{Control Weather} ritual, with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.</p>\n<p>If a coven member's departure or death brings the coven below three members, the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for 24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the necessary actions, they can't cast coven spells.</p>",
          "Darkvision": "<p>A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4GE2ZdODgIQtg51c]{Darkness} spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.4Ho2xMPEC05aSxzr]{Greater Darkvision}, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.</p>",
          "Disease": "<p>When a creature is exposed to a monster's disease, it attempts a Fortitude save or succumbs to the disease. The level of a disease is the level of the monster inflicting the disease. The disease follows the rules for afflictions.</p>",
          "Engulf": "<p>The monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any creature of the monster's size or smaller whose space the monster moves through can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the monster's path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of the monster's movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.</p>\n<p>A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster's body. It is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}, is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The creature takes the listed amount of damage when first engulfed and at the end of each of its turns while it's engulfed. An engulfed creature can get free by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escaping} against the listed escape DC. An engulfed creature can attack the monster engulfing it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free.\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-effects.Item.1cbIe569UD6paXad]{Effect: Engulf and Swallow Whole}</p>\n<p>A creature that gets free by either method can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p>\n<p>If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are automatically released as the monster's form loses cohesion.</p>",
          "FastHealing": "<p>A monster with this ability regains the given number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn.</p>",
          "Ferocity": "<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The monster is reduced to 0 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster avoids being knocked out and remains at 1 HP, but its @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded} value increases by 1.

          "Telepathy": "<p>A monster with telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.</p>",
          "Thoughtsense": "<p>Thoughtsense allows a monster to sense all non-mindless creatures at the listed range.</p>",

          "Tremorsense": "<p>Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface.</p>",
          "TroopDefenses": "<p>Troops are composed of many individuals, represented by four \"segments\" on a battle grid. Each segment is 10 feet on each side and as tall as the individual members of the troop. Segments must remain contiguous. Each one has to share at least 5 feet of one of its edges with another segment—being adjacent on a diagonal isn't sufficient! You can measure flanking, cover, and the like using the center of any segment.</p>\n<p>A troop has two Hit Point thresholds in its HP entry and loses segments as it crosses thresholds. Typically, the higher threshold is at 2/3 of the troop's maximum Hit Points and the lower is at 1/3 of its maximum. Once the troop drops below the higher threshold, it loses one segment, leaving three segments (12 squares) remaining and setting the first threshold as the troop's new maximum Hit Points. This repeats when the troop drops below the lower threshold, leaving two segments (8 squares). At 0 Hit Points, the troop disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing}, or easily dispatched, as determined by the GM. Typically the creature who caused the troop to lose a segment decides which to remove, or the GM decides when a specific creature wasn't responsible. To restore lost segments and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen.</p>\n<p>Troops are typically immune to non-damaging effects that target a single creature, such as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6]{Charm} spell or the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2u915NdUyQan6uKF]{Demoralize} action. An ability that can target 5 or more creatures can target an entire segment, increasing to two segments if it can target 10 or more creatures and to the entire troop if it can target 20 or more creatures. An ability that affects all creatures in a certain range affects all segments in range (make any checks or saves separately for each segment). As examples, an 8th rank <em>charm</em> spell (with 10 targets) can affect two segments, and an ability that Demoralizes all creatures within 30 feet of you would affect all segments that are fully within that range. A non-damaging ability that would prevent a segment from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more removes the segment entirely. The troop loses a number of HP required to bring it to the next threshold. If an ability both deals damage and has a non-damaging effect, apply the damage then the rest of the effect.</p>",
          "TroopMovement": "<p>Whenever a troop moves, you move one of its segments and the other segments follow behind it. At the end of the movement, you can group the other segments adjacent to the one you moved as you see fit, provided none of them moves farther than the moving segment. If you choose not to move the troop any distance, you can instead reshape the position of all the segments as long as one stays in place.</p>",
          "Wavesense": "<p>This sense allows a monster to feel vibrations caused by movement through a liquid. It's an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability).

    "PreciousMaterialAbysiumDescription": "A blue-green metal with an eerie green luminescence, abysium radiates power that's inimical to life. Careless exposure to the material can lead to long-term damage to the immune system; as such, mining abysium is hazardous, as large quantities of the metal in an area cause all nearby creatures to become sick. A creature carrying an abysium object is sickened 1 for a standard-grade object of light Bulk, sickened 2 for a standard-grade object of 1 Bulk or more or a high-grade object of light Bulk, or sickened 3 for a high-grade object of 1 Bulk or more. This and all other sickening effects of abysium are poison effects. Crafters can use 1 abysium chunk to create up to 6 doses of poisonous abysium powder. Unscrupulous smiths have harnessed abysium's toxic properties to create noxious weapons and deadly substances. All objects crafted from abysium shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.",

    "PreciousMaterialDawnsilverDescription": "Dawnsilver is renowned for its lightness, durability, and effectiveness against a range of creatures including devils and lycanthropes. It has the same sheen as silver but a slightly lighter hue. Dawnsilver weapons and armor are treated as if they were silver for the purpose of damaging creatures with weakness to silver. A metal item made of dawnsilver is lighter than one made of iron or steel: the item's Bulk is reduced by 1 (reduced to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of this material is based on the item's normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of dawnsilver, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.",
    "PreciousMaterialDjezet": "Djezet",
    "PreciousMaterialDjezetDescription": "This rust red metal is liquid at room temperature, making it challenging for all but the most skilled metallurgists to craft with and earning it the name \"quickiron\" in some places. Djezet is also extremely reactive to magic, even in its solid, workable alloyed form. It glows when targeted by magic, and objects crafted with djezet alloys glow with scarlet striations, which lead some smiths to nickname it \"tiger iron.\" When targeted by spells, objects crafted from djezet alloys exhibit these glowing red markings that last for 1 round or the duration of the spell, whichever is longer. A djezet mass contains enough djezet to refine into up to two djezet doses.",

Due to the scales' resiliency, it can also be used to Craft armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate, half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type, depending on the type of dragon.",
    "PreciousMaterialDreamweb": "Dreamweb",
    "PreciousMaterialDreamwebDescription": "Made from the webs spun from the thorax of the Weaver of Webs herself, dreamweb offers a number of mystic benefits. Cloth items and rope made from dream web have Hardness 4 with 12 HP per inch and a break DC of 16. Light armor made from dream web is lighter than normal cloth or leather: the armor's Bulk is reduced by 1 (reduced to light Bulk if the armor's normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). Light armor made from dream web grants the wearer poison resistance equal to 3 plus the value of its armor potency rune.",
    "PreciousMaterialDuskwood": "Duskwood",
    "PreciousMaterialDuskwoodDescription": "Duskwood is a very lightweight wood found primarily in old- growth forests in south-central Avistan; it is dark as ebony but has a slight purple tint. A duskwood item's Bulk is reduced by 1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of duskwood is based on the item's normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of duskwood, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.",
    "PreciousMaterialGradeLabel": "Precious Material Grade",
    "PreciousMaterialGrisantianPelt": "Grisantian Pelt",
    "PreciousMaterialGrisantianPeltDescription": "This supernaturally tough animal skin is gold and shines in sunlight. It can be used to make any item usually made of cloth, leather, or hide. This material is immune to fire, and its Hardness is doubled against piercing or slashing damage. Up to 4 Bulk of grisantian pelt can be harvested from a single creature (this is usually more than enough for 4 suits of standard grade armor or 2 suit of high-grade armor).",
    "PreciousMaterialHighGrade": "High-Grade",
    "PreciousMaterialInubrix": "Inubrix",
    "PreciousMaterialInubrixDescription": "This pale, malleable metal's unusual molecular structure allows it to partially pass through iron and steel without touching them. While this property is useful for making weapons that bypass metal armor, inubrix is barely sturdier than lead. Even in an alloyed state, this skymetal is so fragile that it's difficult to use in crafting reliable shields and less than ideal for crafting armor.",
    "PreciousMaterialLabel": "Precious Material",
    "PreciousMaterialLowGrade": "Low-Grade",
    "PreciousMaterialKeepStone": "Keep Stone",
    "PreciousMaterialKeepStoneDescription": "The crowning achievement of Highhelm's millennia of metallurgical advancements and engineering is the beautiful alloy called keep stone. Despite its name, no stone is used in the production of keep stone. Through the use of a highly guarded process that smelts together adamantine and lead, Highhelm's greatest crafters were able to develop a material with an appearance that more closely resembles marble than metal. Keep stone is only slightly weaker than adamantine alone, but with the incredible ability to disrupt magic. Any spell or magical effect targeting raw keep stone must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the effect is lost.",
    "PreciousMaterialNoqual": "Noqual",
    "PreciousMaterialNoqualDescription": "Light and strong, noqual also demonstrates a powerful resistance to magic. A side effect of this resistance is that making magical weapons out of noqual requires complex and expensive alchemical treatments. Kevoth-Kul, the Black Sovereign of Numeria, has developed an alloy of noqual and cold iron known as sovereign steel to help mitigate this property. The metal's crystalline appearance might suggest that it's fragile, but the pale-green material can be worked similarly to iron. Objects made of noqual have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item attempts and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the rusting grasp spell).",
    "PreciousMaterialOrichalcum": "Orichalcum",
    "PreciousMaterialOrichalcumDescription": "The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery metal isn't as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum's time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn't destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.",
    "PreciousMaterialPeachwood": "Peachwood",
    "PreciousMaterialPeachwoodDescription": "Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight. Peachwood is treated as duskwood for any undead creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to duskwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a jiang-shi's resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. Strikes with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standard-grade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.",
    "PreciousMaterialSiccatite": "Siccatite",
    "PreciousMaterialSiccatiteDescription": "In its raw state, this silvery ore is either scalding hot or freezing cold. Metallurgists disagree over whether siccatite is two related substances or one substance that determines its temperature output via some unknown process. Whatever the reason, the extreme temperature of the material means it must be handled carefully. Hot siccatite can easily ignite flammables such as paper and dry brush, and cold siccatite left in moist areas quickly surrounds itself with a thick layer of ice. A creature that comes into physical contact with a significant amount of siccatite takes 1 energy Damage for each round of continued contact (either fire or cold damage, for hot and cold siccatite respectively).",
    "PreciousMaterialSilver": "Silver",
    "PreciousMaterialSilverDescription": "Silver weapons are a bane to creatures ranging from devils to werewolves. Silver items are less durable than steel items, and low-grade silver items are usually merely silver-plated.",
    "PreciousMaterialSisterstone": "Sisterstone",
    "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneDescription": "Sisterstone is a term used for two closely related ores infused by the spiritual runoff in the Field of Maidens, dusk sisterstone and scarlet sisterstone. They have the same physical properties except for color-dusk sisterstone is a pale orange while scarlet sisterstone is orange-red. When near an object made of the other type of sisterstone, they both begin exuding spiritual energy that repels undead.",
    "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneDusk": "Sisterstone (Dusk)",
    "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneScarlet": "Sisterstone (Scarlet)",
    "PreciousMaterialSloughstone": "Sloughstone",
    "PreciousMaterialSloughstoneDescription": "Weapons made from sloughstone exploit Verex-That-Was's hatred of his unwilling transformation, turning his own flesh against him. Processing sloughstone is difficult and unpleasant, increasing the DC to craft an item with the material by 4. Structures can't be made out of sloughstone.",
    "PreciousMaterialSovereignSteel": "Sovereign Steel",
    "PreciousMaterialSovereignSteelDescription": "Created by Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul, this unique alloy of cold iron and the skymetal noqual can provide protection from magical assault. The process of cold-forging the two materials together is quite complicated and precise. Characters in search of sovereign steel weapons and armor will almost assuredly have to travel to Starfall to procure gear made from this rare alloy. While some believe it possible to craft shields of sovereign steel as well, in one of his fits, Kevoth-Kul yelled that he had no use for them and banned anyone from making such a thing. So far, his smiths have been too afraid to confirm whether or not it was a joke. All sovereign steel items (including weapon and armor below) have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item makes, and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the rusting grasp spell).",
    "PreciousMaterialStandardGrade": "Standard-Grade",
    "PreciousMaterialWarpglass": "Warpglass",
    "PreciousMaterialWarpglassDescription": "This bizarre substance is fashioned from the raw, chaotic quintessence of the Maelstrom. It can be fashioned into weapons and items, but is too unstable to make into useful armor or shields. Raw warpglass is an opalescent glassy material with surprising strength. When worked, it changes its appearance-though not its properties-to appear as random striations of other metals and types of stone.",

    "TraitDescriptionAcid": "Effects with this trait deal acid damage. Creatures with this trait have a magical connection to acid.",
    "TraitDescriptionAdditive": "Feats with the additive trait allow you to add special substances to alchemical consumables you create when you use Quick Alchemy to create a consumable (you can't use additives with quick vials). You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, you can add an additive only once per round, and most additive abilities specify a subset of alchemical consumables you can add them to.",
    "TraitDescriptionAdjusted": "The equipment comes with an adjustment described in its entry. This adjustment is built into the equipment permanently, meaning the equipment can't have another adjustment added, nor can it be swapped out for a different adjustment. If the adjustment alters the item's base statistics, such as adding the noisy trait, that's reflected in the equipment's table entry.",
    "TraitDescriptionAdjustment": "Items with this trait are intended to alter existing pieces of equipment, typically armors, shields, and weapons. The given item will note which type of equipment it modifies. A piece of equipment can only be affected by a single adjustment at a time. Unless otherwise noted, adding or removing an adjustment requires using a 10-minute activity and a repair kit.",

    "TraitDescriptionAlchemist": "This indicates abilities from the alchemist class.",
    "TraitDescriptionAmp": "An amp is a special thoughtform that modifies the properties of your psi cantrips. Psi cantrips each have their own amp, and feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psi cantrips in place of their normal amps.",
    "TraitDescriptionAmphibious": "An amphibious creature can breathe in water and in air, even outside of its preferred environment, usually indefinitely but at least for hours.

    "TraitDescriptionAnimist": "This indicates abilities from the animist class.",
    "TraitDescriptionApex": "<p>When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your attributes, either increasing the attribute's modifier by 1 or to a total of +4, whichever would give you a higher value. This gives you all the benefits of the new attribute modifier until the investiture ends. For example, in addition to increasing rolls you make using the attribute, increasing your Intelligence lets you become trained in an additional skill and learn a new language, and increasing your Constitution gives you more Hit Points.</p><p>An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it's invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don't gain the attribute modifier increase, though you do gain any other effects of Investing the Item.</p>",
    "TraitDescriptionAphorite": "A type of planar scion descended from a being from Axis, the Plane of Law.",
    "TraitDescriptionApparition": "<p>Apparitions are spiritual entities who generally lack the power, cohesiveness, or attachments to enter or affect the physical world. Unlike a ghost or phantom, an apparition does not need to have ever been a living creature and could be the spiritual memory of a particularly meaningful location or event. Apparitions are reliant on animists to interact with other people and things, and generally can't be targeted or affected by spells and abilities other than those of the animist they are attuned to. Animist feats and abilities that affect spirits affect apparitions only if they specifically say so.</p><p> Animist abilities with the apparition trait involve one or more of your apparitions acting alongside you. You must be attuned to at least one apparition to use an apparition ability, and some abilities might state in their requirements more specifically which apparition you must be attuned to. Typically, you're assumed to always attune to your apparitions during your daily preparations, but in some rare circumstances or as a result of certain animist abilities, your apparitions might be dispersed or separated from you for a time; you aren't attuned to dispersed apparitions.</p>",

    "TraitDescriptionAttached": "An attached weapon must be combined with another piece of gear to be used. The trait lists what type of item the weapon must be attached to. You must be wielding or wearing the item the weapon is attached to in order to attack with it. For example, shield spikes are attached to a shield, allowing you to attack with the spikes instead of a shield bash, but only if you're wielding the shield. An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it's attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful @Check[crafting|dc:10] check; this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.",
    "TraitDescriptionAttack": "An ability with this trait involves an attack. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty.",
    "TraitDescriptionAuditory": "Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.",
    "TraitDescriptionAura": "An aura is an emanation that continually ebbs out from you, affecting creatures within a certain radius. Aura can also refer to the magical signature of an item.",

    "TraitDescriptionBackswing": "You can use the momentum from a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.",
    "TraitDescriptionBarbarian": "This indicates abilities from the barbarian class.",
    "TraitDescriptionBard": "This indicates abilities from the bard class.",
    "TraitDescriptionBarding": "You can purchase special armor for animals, called barding. All animals have a trained proficiency rank in light barding, and combat-trained animals are trained in heavy barding. Barding uses the same rules as armor except for the following. The Price and Bulk of barding depend on the animal's size. Unlike for a suit of armor, barding's Strength entry is listed as a modifier, not a score. Barding can't be etched with magic runes, though special magical barding might be available.",
    "TraitDescriptionBeast": "A creature similar to an animal but with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher is usually a beast. Unlike an animal, a beast might be able to speak and reason.",

    "TraitDescriptionBravado": "Actions with this trait can grant panache, depending on the result of the check involved. If you succeed at the check on a bravado action, you gain panache, and if you fail (but not critically fail) the check, you gain panache but only until the end of your next turn. These effects can be applied even if the action had no other effect due to a failure or a creature's immunity.",
    "TraitDescriptionBrutal": "A ranged attack with this trait uses its Strength modifier instead of Dexterity on the attack roll.",
    "TraitDescriptionBugbear": "A creature with this trait is a furry, stealthy goblinoid. Bugbears tend to have darkvision.",

Capacity is always accompanied by a number indicating the number of barrels or chambers. After a capacity weapon is fired, you can select the next loaded barrel or chamber as an Interact action that doesn't require a free hand. Each barrel or chamber can be reloaded after it's fired as a separate Interact action.",
    "TraitDescriptionCatalyst": "Items that have the catalyst trait are consumable material spell components that alter or magnify specific spells. Activating a catalyst is part of Casting the Spell. The catalyst might increase the number of actions required to Cast the Spell, as indicated in the catalyst's Activate entry. Additionally, the spell gains the manipulate trait if it didn't already. Because the catalyst becomes part of the spell, you can draw the catalyst as part of Casting the Spell.",
    "TraitDescriptionCatfolk": "A creature with this trait is a member of the catfolk ancestry. Catfolk are humanoids with feline features.",
    "TraitDescriptionCelestial": "Creatures that hail from or have a strong connection to the holy planes are called celestials. Celestials can survive the basic environmental effects of planes in the Outer Sphere.",

    "TraitDescriptionCentaur": "Centaurs have humanoid upper bodies and equine lower bodies.",
    "TraitDescriptionCertainKill": "The Lightkeeper can use a Certain Kill Art as long as they are within the Glass Lighthouse—these abilities, which have the certain kill trait, cause obvious distortions in the Lighthouse's fabric as the user calls upon their technique.

    "TraitDescriptionCharauKa": "Mandrill-like humanoids that are brutal warriors. Many charau-ka live in Usaro.",
    "TraitDescriptionClass": "Archetypes with the class trait fundamentally diverge from your class's specialties but still fit within the theme of your class. You can select a class archetype only if your class meets the criteria listed in the archetype's prerequisites. Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a class's static class features in addition to any new feats they offer. It might be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level if it alters or replaces some of the class's initial class features. The 1st-level ability is presented much like a class feature and includes the class archetype's prerequisites and rules on how it changes your class. If you select this ability, you must take that archetype's dedication feat at 2nd level, and you proceed normally afterward. You can never have more than one class archetype.",
    "TraitDescriptionCleric": "This indicates abilities from the cleric class.",
    "TraitDescriptionClimbing": "The hand wielding the weapon is available to Climb.",
    "TraitDescriptionClockwork": "Clockworks are intricate, complex constructs that can be programmed to perform specific functions.",
    "TraitDescriptionCoagulant": "Healing alchemical items with the coagulant trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short period of time.

    "TraitDescriptionCoatl": "A family of supernatural feathered serpents who serve as guardians and messengers in the Universe for various holy divinities.",
    "TraitDescriptionCobbled": "This firearm is cobbled together and likely to misfire. No matter how well you upkeep it, on a failed attack roll, the attack misses and you must roll a @Check[flat|dc:5]. If you fail this check, the weapon misfires.",
    "TraitDescriptionCoda": "<p>Instruments with the coda trait work mostly like staves and have the staff trait. There are two differences: Coda instruments are in the form of musical instruments, and they can be prepared only by bards. Because they're not physically staves, you can't attack with a coda instrument, nor can you etch it with weapon runes.</p><p>The process of preparing a coda instrument involves playing significant portions of songs related to the spells within the instrument—either old standards or ones of your own creation. This leaves magical reverberations within the instrument that allow you to complete the songs by playing their coda later in the day.</p>",
    "TraitDescriptionCold": "Effects with this trait deal cold damage. Creatures with this trait have a connection to magical cold.",
    "TraitDescriptionCombination": "This is a trait for weapons that combine the functionality of melee weapons and firearms in unique or unusual ways. A combination weapon has both a firearm form or usage and a melee weapon form or usage.",
    "TraitDescriptionComfort": "The armor is so comfortable that you can rest normally while wearing it.",
    "TraitDescriptionCommon": "Anything that doesn't list another rarity trait (uncommon, rare, or unique) automatically has the common trait. This rarity indicates that an ability, item, or spell is available to all players who meet the prerequisites for it. A creature of this rarity is generally known and can be summoned with the appropriate summon spell.",

    "TraitDescriptionComposition": "To cast a composition cantrip or focus spell, you use a type of Performance. If the spell requires an auditory performance, you might recite a poem, sing a song, or perform a dramatic monologue. If the spell requires a visual performance, you might dance or pantomime.

If you cast a new composition spell, any ongoing effects from your previous composition spell end immediately.",

    "TraitDescriptionConcentrate": "An action with this trait requires a degree of mental concentration and discipline.",
    "TraitDescriptionConcussive": "These weapons smash as much as puncture. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.",
    "TraitDescriptionConrasu": "A people that are made of cosmic force given consciousness and housed within unique exoskeletons.",

Constructs are often mindless; they are immune to bleed, death effects, disease, healing, nonlethal attacks, poison, spirit, vitality, void, and the doomed, drained, fatigued, paralyzed, sickened, and unconscious conditions; and they may have Hardness based on the materials used to construct their bodies. Constructs are not living creatures, nor are they undead. When reduced to 0 Hit Points, a construct creature is destroyed.",
    "TraitDescriptionConsumable": "An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless stated otherwise, it's destroyed after activation. Consumable items include alchemical items and magical consumables such as scrolls and talismans. When a character creates consumable items, they can make them in batches of four.",
    "TraitDescriptionContact": "A contact poison is activated by applying it to an item or directly onto a living creature's skin. The first creature to touch the affected item must attempt a saving throw against the poison; if the poison is applied directly, the creature must attempt a saving throw immediately when the poison touches its skin. Contact poisons are infeasible to apply to a creature via a weapon attack due to the logistics of delivering them without poisoning yourself. Typically, the onset time of a contact poison is 1 minute.",
    "TraitDescriptionContingency": "Spells with this trait grant you an action during the spell's effects, typically a reaction with a special trigger. They typically have a long duration, such as 24 hours. You can have only one spell with the contingency trait, or one contingency spell, active at a time. If you cast another spell with the contingency trait or contingency, the newer casting supersedes the older.",
    "TraitDescriptionContract": "A contract is a type of item that magically establishes an agreement between multiple parties and typically grants magical benefits.",
    "TraitDescriptionCriticalFusion": "Critical fusion is a new trait for combination weapons that grants you two additional options for the critical specialization effect when using the combination weapon's melee version to make a melee attack while the firearm is loaded. If you choose to use one of them, they replace the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect. First, you can discharge the firearm to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the firearm to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack them in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both of these options discharge the firearm, which typically means you have to reload it before firing it again.",
    "TraitDescriptionCurse": "A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses.",
    "TraitDescriptionCursebound": "Spells with this trait increase the severity of your oracular curse when cast. Usually, only revelation spells have this trait. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse. A cursebound ability that allows a defense uses your spell attack modifier or spell DC unless noted otherwise.",
    "TraitDescriptionCursed": "An item with this trait is cursed to cause trouble for its owner. A curse isn't detected when the item is identified, though a critical success reveals both the presence and exact nature of the curse. Cursed items can't be discarded once they've been triggered or invested the first time. The item can be removed only if the curse is removed.",
    "TraitDescriptionDaemon": "A family of fiends spawned on the desolate plane of Abaddon, most daemons are irredeemably unholy. They typically have darkvision and weakness to holy.",
    "TraitDescriptionDarkness": "Darkness effects extinguish non-magical light in the area, and can counteract less powerful magical light.

    "TraitDescriptionDarvakka": "Entropic undead creatures twisted by the Netherworld and the Void.",
    "TraitDescriptionDeadly": "On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon's damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune. For instance, a rapier with a greater striking rune deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon's normal damage dice doesn't change the size of its deadly die.",
    "TraitDescriptionDeath": "An effect with the death trait kills you immediately if it reduces you to 0 HP. Some death effects can bring you closer to death or slay you outright without reducing you to 0 HP.",
    "TraitDescriptionDedication": "Each archetype's dedication feat represents your character's dedicated effort learning a new set of abilities, making it impossible to split your focus and pursue another archetype at the same time. Once you take a dedication feat, you can't select a different dedication feat until you complete your dedication by taking two other feats from your current archetype. You can't retrain a dedication feat as long as you have any other feats from that archetype.",
    "TraitDescriptionDeflecting": "This shield is designed to block or divert certain types of attacks or weapons. Increase the shield's Hardness against the listed type of attack by 2.",
    "TraitDescriptionDemon": "A family of fiends, demons hail from or trace their origins to the Outer Rifts. Most are irredeemably unholy and have darkvision and weaknesses to cold iron and holy.",
    "TraitDescriptionDero": "This family of humanoids are the descendants of fey creatures that fell into darkness and confusion after being abandoned in the Darklands. They are immune to confusion and vulnerable to sunlight.",

    "TraitDescriptionDinosaur": "These reptiles have survived from prehistoric times.",
    "TraitDescriptionDisarm": "You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.",
    "TraitDescriptionDisease": "An effect with this trait applies one or more diseases. A disease is typically an affliction.",

    "TraitDescriptionEntrench": "You can position yourself in the armor or reposition its articulated pieces to better protect against some attacks. If you're trained in this armor, while wearing it you can spend a single action to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against a certain type of attack until the start of your next turn. The entrench trait lists the type of attack this bonus applies against, typically entrench melee or entrench ranged.",
    "TraitDescriptionEnvironmental": "A hazard with this trait is something dangerous that's part of the natural world, such as quicksand or harmful mold.",
    "TraitDescriptionEsoterica": "The esoterica trait is present in many thaumaturge feats and class features that incorporate the various talismans, supernatural trinkets, and other objects you carry with you. Abilities that have the esoterica trait require you to be in possession of your esoterica to use them. Normally, you're assumed to always have your esoterica with you, but in some rare circumstances, you might either not have them on hand or have your gear stripped from you.",
    "TraitDescriptionEthereal": "Ethereal creatures are natives of the Ethereal Plane. They can survive the basic environmental effects of the Ethereal Plane.",
    "TraitDescriptionEvolution": "Feats with this trait affect your eidolon instead of you, typically by granting it additional physical capabilities.",
    "TraitDescriptionExpandable": "An item with the expandable trait increases to a specific size when activated. Unless otherwise noted, this space must be adjacent to you and on the ground, and the item needs to have enough open space to expand into or else the activation has no effect. When the effect ends, the expanded item disintegrates if it's a consumable or shrinks back to its normal size if it's not a consumable.",
    "TraitDescriptionExemplar": "This indicates abilities from the exemplar class.",

    "TraitDescriptionFatalAim": "It's possible to hold the stock of this weapon under one arm so you can fire it with a single hand as long as the other hand isn't holding a weapon, shield, or anything else you would need to move and position, to ensure the weapon doesn't slip out from under your arm. However, if you use both hands, the weapon can make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands, it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die. Holding the weapon underarm stably enough to fire is significantly more complicated than just releasing one hand from the weapon, so to switch between the two grips, you must do so with an Interact action rather than Releasing or as part of reloading.",
    "TraitDescriptionFear": "Fear effects evoke the emotion of fear. Effects with this trait always have the mental and emotion traits as well.",

    "TraitDescriptionFinesse": "You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still use your Strength modifier when calculating damage.",
    "TraitDescriptionFinisher": "Finishers are spectacular finishing moves. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can't use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure. If your finisher succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead.",
    "TraitDescriptionFinite": "Planes with this trait consist of a limited amount of space.",

    "TraitDescriptionFocus": "Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from a branch of study, from a deity, or from another specific source. You can learn focus spells only through special class features or feats, rather than choosing them from a spell list. Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool of Focus Points—you can't prepare a focus spell in a spell slot or use your spell slots to cast focus spells; similarly, you can't spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren't focus spells.",
    "TraitDescriptionFocused": "An item with this trait can give you an additional Focus Point. This focus point is separate from your focus pool and doesn't count toward the cap on your focus pool. You can gain this benefit only if you have a focus pool, and there might be restrictions on how the point can be used. You can't gain more than 1 Focus Point per day from focused items.",
    "TraitDescriptionFoldaway": "<p>This shield can collapse into a smaller form attached to a gauntlet for stability and easy travel. You can use an Interact action to deploy or stow the shield. While it's deployed, you can Raise the Shield as long as you have that hand free or are holding an object of light Bulk that's not a weapon in that hand. The shield impedes the use of your hand while it's deployed. Though you can still hold items in that hand, you can't wield weapons in that hand, operate anything that takes two hands, or attack with the gauntlet.</p><p>A foldaway shield must be attached to a gauntlet for stability. It can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove the shield from a previous gauntlet, if necessary. If the gauntlet is destroyed, the foldaway shield can usually be salvaged. The collapsible nature of the shield makes it impossible to affix an attached weapon to it.</p>",
    "TraitDescriptionForce": "Effects with this trait deal force damage or create objects made of pure magical force.",
    "TraitDescriptionForceful": "This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.",
    "TraitDescriptionFortune": "A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
    "TraitDescriptionFreeHand": "This weapon doesn't take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can't be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can't attack with a free-hand weapon if you're wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you're not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.",
    "TraitDescriptionFulu": "Fulus are small paper charms that can be affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, a weapon, a creature, or even a structure. Some fulus are composed of multiple such charms, taking effect only once all have been affixed. Normal fulus have effects immediately once affixed, while fulu talismans have an effect only once activated. Once a fulu has been activated, it lasts for the given duration and then burns out. Unless otherwise noted, fulus expire one year after being created, reverting to mundane paper. All fulus have the fulu and consumable traits. Fulus also have a tradition trait—either arcane, divine, occult or primal—determined by the magical tradition of its creator. For example, a fulu created by a priest would have the divine trait, whereas a witch who dabbles in fate might create a fulu with the occult trait. Some fulus also have the talisman trait, if they work similarly to talismans (such as being affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, or a weapon. Each fulu's stat block indicates the type of item or creature it can be affixed to. Affixing or removing a fulu requires using the Affix a Fulu activity, or the Affix a Talisman action instead if the fulu is also a talisman.",

    "TraitDescriptionGoloma": "Insular humanoids that bear countless eyes.",
    "TraitDescriptionGraft": "<p>An item that has the graft trait is a living tissue sample that has been implanted into a host. It's permanently a part of the subject's body and reduces the number of items that creature can invest per day by 1. Each graft has the invested trait to indicate this limitation—a graft is like an invested item that the host creature has no choice but to invest. If a creature gets a new graft when their limit on invested items has already been reduced to zero, the host body rejects the graft. Once fully implanted, a graft cannot take damage separately.</p><p>If a graft is ever severed from the host body, it can be reattached by any effect that can typically reattach limbs or organs, such as the regenerate spell. A grafter can remove a grant using the same process required to implant one, though this does not necessarily restore any organs replaced by the graft initially. Grafts typically require specialized storage conditions, such as alchemical tanks, to remain viable outside of a host. Grafts can usually be upgraded into their greater versions by having a grafter apply additional surgeries, mutagenic development, or similar medical procedures</p>",
    "TraitDescriptionGrapple": "You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
    "TraitDescriptionGremlin": "Cruel and mischievous fey, gremlins have acclimated to life in the Universe.",
    "TraitDescriptionGrimoire": "Spellbooks are useful tools for any magic user to write down incantations and runes of power, but where most spellbooks are nothing more than ink on parchment, grimoires have absorbed the magic of the spells within—magic that knowledgeable spellcasters can use to augment their spells.",

    "TraitDescriptionHampering": "After you hit with the weapon, you can use an Interact action to give the target a –10-foot circumstance penalty to all Speeds. The penalty ends after the target takes a move action, at the start of your next turn, if you attack with the weapon, or if you move out of reach of the target, whichever comes first.",
    "TraitDescriptionHarnessed": "This shield features a special brace or opening designed to hold jousting weapons.",
    "TraitDescriptionHaunt": "A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo, often of someone with a tragic death. Putting a haunt to rest often involves resolving the haunt's unfinished business. A haunt that hasn't been properly put to rest always returns after a time.",
    "TraitDescriptionHealing": "A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.",
    "TraitDescriptionHefty": "A hefty shield is so heavy that raising it takes more effort. Raising a Shield with the hefty trait is a 2-action activity unless your Strength score equals or exceeds the number with the trait.",
    "TraitDescriptionHerald": "Nearly all deities have a specific representative known as a herald; heralds are as diverse in their appearances and abilities as the gods themselves. A creature with the herald type is always unique.",
    "TraitDescriptionHex": "A hex is a spell caused by your patron's direct attention and intervention. Your patron does not take well to being disturbed repeatedly, so you can cast only one spell that has the hex trait each turn; attempts to use a second automatically fail and usually cause your familiar to hiss in displeasure as your patron rejects your call.",
    "TraitDescriptionHindering": "This armor is so heavy and bulky it slows you down no matter what. You take a -5 penalty to all your Speeds (to a minimum of a 5-foot Speed). This is separate from and in addition to the armor's Speed penalty, and affects you even if your Strength or an ability lets you reduce or ignore the armor's Speed penalty.",
    "TraitDescriptionHobgoblin": "A creature with this trait is a tall, militaristic goblinoid. Hobgoblins tend to have darkvision.",
    "TraitDescriptionHoly": "Effects with the holy trait are tied to powerful magical forces of benevolence and virtue. They often have stronger effects on unholy creatures.

    "TraitDescriptionIkon": "An item with the ikon trait is a special item provided or created by an exemplar's divinity that is so tied to that exemplar that it can serve as a sacred vessel for their might. You gain three ikons at first level. Each ikon has a passive immanence ability and an activated transcendence ability. A feat with the ikon trait imbues one of your ikons with further capabilities. Whenever you gain a feat with the ikon trait, choose which of your ikons gains that ability; if you have multiple ikons that meet the feat's usage requirements, you can take the feat multiple times to apply its effects to another one of your ikons. These feats list what ikon they can be imbued into, and any number of them can be imbued into a single ikon.",
    "TraitDescriptionIllusion": "Effects and magic items with this trait involve false sensory stimuli.",
    "TraitDescriptionImpulse": "The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.",
    "TraitDescriptionIncapacitation": "An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it's harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell's rank treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.",
    "TraitDescriptionIncarnate": "A spell with the incarnate trait is similar in theme to spells that summon creatures, but it doesn't conjure a minion with the summoned trait. Instead, when summoned, the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish Casting the Spell. At the end of your next turn, the incarnate creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another movement type it has (such as Climb or Burrow), and then takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the word “Arrive” or “Depart” respectively, along with any traits. A creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines what the incarnate would do. It might even become more inclined to do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings. The incarnate is not fully a creature. It can't take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes, spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as dispel magic). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it doesn't block movement. If applicable, its effects use your spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.",
    "TraitDescriptionIncorporeal": "An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can't perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1 until the end of its turn. A corporeal and an incorporeal creature can pass through one another, but they can't end their movement in each other's space. An incorporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects—only against incorporeal ones—unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects. Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage, spirit damage, and damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",
    "TraitDescriptionInevitable": "These constructed aeons were created by the axiomites. Each type of inevitable is dedicated to a specific task. Most inevitables have weakness to chaotic damage.",
    "TraitDescriptionInfused": "An alchemical item with the infused trait has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any non-permanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.",
    "TraitDescriptionInfusion": "Actions with the infusion trait tweak your kineticist impulses. You must use an infusion action directly before the impulse action you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than an impulse action directly after, you waste the benefits of the infusion action. Any additional effects added by an infusion action are part of the impulse's effect, not of the infusion action itself.",
    "TraitDescriptionIngested": "An ingested poison is activated by applying it to food or drink to be consumed by a living creature, or by placing it directly into a living creature's mouth. A creature attempts a saving throw against such a poison when it consumes the poison or the food or drink treated with the poison. The onset time of ingested poisons typically ranges anywhere from 1 minute to 1 day.",
    "TraitDescriptionInhaled": "An inhaled poison is activated by unleashing it from its container.

    "TraitDescriptionInjection": "This weapon can be filled with an injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with the weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison with a single Interact action. Refilling the weapon with a new substance requires 3 Interact actions and uses two hands.",
    "TraitDescriptionInjury": "An injury poison is activated by applying it to a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the first Strike made using the poisoned item. If that Strike is a success and deals piercing or slashing damage, the target must attempt a saving throw against the poison. On a failed Strike, the target is unaffected, but the poison remains on the weapon and you can try again. On a critical failure, or if the Strike fails to deal slashing or piercing damage for some other reason, the poison is spent but the target is unaffected.",

    "TraitDescriptionLaunching": "A mechanism within this shield can shoot projectiles, causing the shield to also function as a ranged weapon. The trait lists the type of weapon, such as \"launching dart.\" Striking with the launcher requires the same number of hands as normal, except that the hand holding the shield counts toward this total, so a one-handed ranged weapon would require only one hand. Reloading takes the normal number of Interact actions, to a minimum of 1 action, and you can't use the hand holding your shield to reload.",
    "TraitDescriptionLeshy": "A creature with this trait is a member of the leshy ancestry. These small plant or fungus creatures are humanoid in form.",

    "TraitDescriptionLozenge": "You Activate an alchemical lozenge by putting it in your mouth. It stays there, slowly dissolving and releasing its ingredients over time. You can bite a lozenge for a secondary effect. The action this takes is noted in the item. As soon as this secondary effect is over, the lozenge is used up and its benefits for you end. You can drink elixirs, potions, and beverages with a lozenge in your mouth, but you can't benefit from more than one lozenge at a time. If you have two lozenges in your mouth at the same time, both become inert. You can also spit out a lozenge as a single action to end its effect and make it inert. A lozenge dissolves due to its alchemical ingredients, so it typically still works even if you don't have saliva.",
    "TraitDescriptionMagical": "Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait.

When you take this action, you can choose to replace any damage it deals with mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.",
    "TraitDescriptionMinion": "<p>Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that's a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain the effect; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits.

If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
    "TraitDescriptionMissive": "A missive is a piece of magical stationery that must be crafted and composed before it can be activated. All missives have the missive and consumable traits.

The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.",

If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry. If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",

    "TraitDescriptionPossession": "Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can't use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor's true body is unconscious (and can't wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target's active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target's abilities that are purely physical, and it can't use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target's attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor's invested items apply when using its own values, and the target's invested items apply when using the target's values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn't in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.",

An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)",
    "TraitDescriptionPrimal": "This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical. A creature with this trait is primarily constituted of or has a strong connection to primal magic.",

    "TraitDescriptionRanger": "This indicates abilities from the ranger class.",
    "TraitDescriptionRare": "This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world.

    "TraitDescriptionRelic": "An item with the relic trait grows in power with its wielder.",
    "TraitDescriptionReload": "While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.",
    "TraitDescriptionRepeating": "These weapons can't be loaded with individual bolts or bullets like other crossbows and firearms; instead, they require a magazine of specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special slot. Once that magazine is in place, the ammunition is automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry (typically 0). When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must be loaded, which requires a free hand and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in place). These actions don't need to be consecutive.",

    "TraitDescriptionShisk": "Secretive humanoids covered in bony plumage that reside underground.",
    "TraitDescriptionShoony": "A creature with this trait is a member of the shoony ancestry.",
    "TraitDescriptionShove": "You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
    "TraitDescriptionSkeleton": "This undead is made by animating a dead creature's skeleton with void energy. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by skeletons.",
    "TraitDescriptionSkelm": "These creatures are monstrous, wrathful misanthropes who seek to control others through anger and spite.",
    "TraitDescriptionSkill": "A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
    "TraitDescriptionSkulk": "Skulks are a family of humanoids whose skin can shift coloration to aid in stealth.",
    "TraitDescriptionSleep": "This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep or get drowsy.",
    "TraitDescriptionSnare": "Traps typically made by rangers, snares follow special rules that allow them to be constructed quickly and used on the battlefield.",
    "TraitDescriptionSocial": "Actions and abilities with the social trait can be used only while a vigilante is in their social identity.",
    "TraitDescriptionSonic": "An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage.",
    "TraitDescriptionSorcerer": "This indicates abilities from the sorcerer class.",
    "TraitDescriptionSoulbound": "These constructs are mentally augmented by a fragment of a once-living creature's soul.",
    "TraitDescriptionSpellgun": "The spellgun trait appears on items that can generate a magical effect that flies out like a bullet. You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple firearms. Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn't actually a firearm. You don't get the damage of a firearm Strike, nor other benefits like critical specialization. Similarly, you can't load or reload a spellgun, affix talismans to one, make a spellgun Strike as part of an action that lets you make a firearm Strike, and so on.",
    "TraitDescriptionSpellheart": "Spellhearts are permanent items that work similarly to talismans. You affix a spellheart using the Affix a Spellheart activity, which is otherwise identical to Affix a Talisman. The limit of one talisman per item remains—an item can have one spellheart or one talisman, not both. When casting a cantrip from a spellheart, you can use your own spell attack roll or spell DC if it's higher. Crafting a spellheart requires the spells the spellheart can cast. For example, a major five-feather wreath requires air walk, gale blast, and wall of wind.",
    "TraitDescriptionSpellshape": "Spellshape actions tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a spellshape action directly before casting the spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than casting a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. The benefit is also lost if your turn ends before you cast the spell. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself.",
    "TraitDescriptionSpirit": "Effects with this trait can affect creatures with spiritual essence and might deal spirit damage. A creature with this trait is defined by its spiritual essence. Spirit creatures often lack a material form.",
    "TraitDescriptionSplash": "Some weapons and effects, such as alchemical bombs, have the splash trait. When you use a weapon or effect with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. A splash weapon or effect deals any listed splash damage to the target on a failure, success, or critical success, and to all other creatures within 5 feet of the target on a success or critical success. On a critical failure, the weapon or effect misses entirely, dealing no damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target's resistance or weakness. You don't multiply splash damage on a critical hit.",
    "TraitDescriptionSplash10": "When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 10 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target's weaknesses or resistances. You don't multiply splash damage on a critical hit.",
    "TraitDescriptionSpriggan": "Kin to gnomes, spriggans tend to be evil and can grow in size to resemble giants.",

    "TraitDescriptionStance": "A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.",

    "TraitDescriptionStrix": "Winged humanoids, most of whom live in and around Cheliax.",
    "TraitDescriptionStructure": "A spell, item activation, or ability with the structure trait creates a magical building or other structure. The structure must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. The structure adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but it can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the structure's foundation (if any) reaches the solid ground. If the structure is on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a @Check[flat|dc:3] each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink or collapse.</p><p>The structure doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the structure when it's created ends up unharmed inside the complete structure and always has a clear path of escape. A creature inside the structure when the effect ends isn't harmed, and it lands harmlessly on the ground if it was on an upper level of the structure",
    "TraitDescriptionSubjectiveGravity": "All bodies of mass can be centers of gravity with the same force, but only if a non-mindless creature wills it. Unattended items, objects, and mindless creatures treat the plane as having microgravity. Creatures on a plane with subjective gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining “down” near their feet. Designating this downward direction is a free action that has the concentration trait. If suspended in midair, a creature can replicate flight by choosing a “down” direction and falling in that direction, moving up to their Speed or fly Speed. This pseudo-flight uses the Fly action.",
    "TraitDescriptionSubtle": "A spell with the subtle trait can be cast without incantations and doesn't have obvious manifestations.",
    "TraitDescriptionSuli": "Sulis are planar scions descended from jann.",
    "TraitDescriptionSurki": "Surkis are a subterranean insectile ancestry that absorb ambient magic and evolve unique adaptations.",
    "TraitDescriptionSummon": "Spells with the summon trait can conjure creatures, typically ones with a particular trait. Such creatures can be found in Monster Core and similar books. Unless noted otherwise, the creature must be common, it gains the summoned trait, and it must appear in an unoccupied space in range large enough to contain it. The highest level of creature the spell can summon depends on the rank of the spell, as listed below. The spell can still summon a creature of a lower level if you so choose. These rules apply only to spells that have the summon trait; other spells that call or conjure items or beings but that don't have the trait, like summon instrument, work as explained in the spell.",
    "TraitDescriptionSummoned": "A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can't summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher rank than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands. Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends.",
    "TraitDescriptionSummoner": "This indicates abilities from the Summoner class.",
    "TraitDescriptionSwashbuckler": "This indicates abilities from the Swashbuckler class.",
    "TraitDescriptionSwarm": "A swarm is a mass or cloud of creatures that functions as one monster. Its size entry gives the size of the entire mass, though for most swarms the individual creatures that make up that mass are Tiny. A swarm can occupy the same space as other creatures and must do so in order to use its damaging action. A swarm typically has weakness to effects that deal damage over an area (like area spells and splash weapons). Swarms are immune to the grappled, prone, and restrained conditions.",
    "TraitDescriptionSweep": "This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.",
    "TraitDescriptionSylph": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Air.",
    "TraitDescriptionTalisman": "A talisman is a small object affixed to armor, a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item). You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman attached to it. Once activated, a talisman burns out permanently.",
    "TraitDescriptionTalos": "Taloses are planar scions descended from zuhras.",
    "TraitDescriptionTandem": "Actions with this trait involve you and your eidolon acting in concert. You can't use a tandem action if either you or your eidolon can't act, if you haven't Manifested your Eidolon, or if you've Manifested your Eidolon in a way where it isn't a separate entity (such as with the Meld into Eidolon feat). Tandem actions often let both you and your eidolon take separate actions, but these must be actions taken separately by you and your eidolon; you can't use a tandem action to take another tandem action.",
    "TraitDescriptionTane": "The Tane are powerful creatures created eons ago by the Eldest of the First World. All of the Tane treat whatever plane they happen to be on as their home plane.",

    "TraitDescriptionTattoo": "A tattoo is a type of item that is drawn or cut into a creature's skin and usually takes the form of images or symbols.",
    "TraitDescriptionTea": "<p>Magic tea is a type of potion. It activates when you drink it, which uses it up. Magic tea has the potion and tea traits. When you craft a dose of magic tea, the raw materials you supply are in the form of unusual and costly tea leaves. The process of crafting magic tea includes infusing the leaves with magical reagents, purifying the water, and steeping the tea in the water, resulting in what's essentially a particularly delicious-tasting potion. You can activate magic tea with an Interact action as you drink it or feed it to another creature, as if it were a potion. You can also activate magic tea with a 10-minute activity that requires sterling tea ware (these artisan's tools can be shared by up to four people who take this activity simultaneously) to prepare the tea and then consume it or present it to someone during a short tea ceremony, after which the magic tea's effects begin; activating magic tea in this way enhances its effect, as detailed in each entry's Tea Ceremony.</p><p>Once you drink a dose of magic tea, you're temporarily immune to that particular type of magic tea for 24 hours.</p>",
    "TraitDescriptionTearing": "This weapon is edged with curved teeth that leave bleeding wounds. When you hit a creature with this weapon, it deals an additional 1 persistent bleed damage. This increases to 2 persistent bleed damage if the weapon has a greater striking rune.",
    "TraitDescriptionTech": "Items with this trait are associated with the technology of Numeria.",

    "TraitDescriptionTengu": "A creature with this trait is a member of the tengu ancestry. Tengus are humanoids who resemble crows. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tengus. An item with this trait is created and used by tengus.",
    "TraitDescriptionTethered": "This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand (including if you've just thrown a two-handed tethered weapon and have a hand holding nothing but the weapon's tether), you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed (unless it's being held by another creature).",
    "TraitDescriptionThaumaturge": "This indicates abilities from the thaumaturge class.",

    "TraitDescriptionTraining": "A training weapon is designed to be used when training an animal to participate in combat by identifying the target for the animal to attack.

    "TraitDescriptionTranscendence": "Transcendence channels the might of an exemplar's divine spark through one of their ikons to surpass the mortal and enact a miraculous deed. Each ikon has an action with the transcendence trait, and using it is called Sparking Transcendence. To use the action, your divine spark must be empowering that ikon and you must have the ikon ready to use (typically holding a weapon ikon or wearing a worn ikon). Immediately after you Spark Transcendence, your divine spark is forcefully ejected from that ikon, coming to rest in another ikon of your choice. You can Spark Transcendence only once each round.

    "TraitDescriptionTrap": "A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to hinder interlopers.",
    "TraitDescriptionTrip": "You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand.

Because they consist of multiple discrete creatures, they can't be summoned.",

The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don't need to have the same runes.",
    "TraitDescriptionTwoHand": "This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from striking runes.",
    "TraitDescriptionUnarmed": "An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.",
    "TraitDescriptionUncommon": "Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures.

    "TraitDescriptionVirulent": "Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction's stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction's stage by only 1 instead of by 2.",

When you cast _detect magic_, you're aware of any creature in the emanation affected by a spell or carrying a magic item, and you determine the main location of magic within any magical hazard in the emanation (with the normal restrictions on detecting illusions).
