          "AquaticAmbush": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster is hiding in water and a creature that hasn't detected it is within the listed number of feet.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster moves up to its swim Speed + 10 feet toward the triggering creature, traveling on water and on land. Once the creature is in reach, the monster makes a Strike against it. The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against this Strike.</p>",
          "AtWillSpells": "<p>The monster can cast its at-will spells any number of times without using up spell slots.</p>",
          "AttackOfOpportunity": "<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>",
          "Aura": "<p>A monster's aura automatically affects everything within a specified emanation around that monster. The monster doesn't need to spend actions on the aura; rather, the aura's effects are applied at specific times, such as when a creature ends its turn in the aura or when creatures enter the aura.</p>\n<p>If an aura does nothing but deal damage, its entry lists only the radius, damage, and saving throw. Such auras deal this damage to a creature when the creature enters the aura and when a creature starts its turn in the aura. A creature can take damage from the aura only once per round.</p>\n<p>The GM might determine that a monster's aura doesn't affect its own allies. For example, a creature might be immune to a monster's frightful presence if they have been around each other for a long time.</p>",
          "Buck": "<hr />\n<p>Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to buck off unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless the mounts are spooked or mistreated.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.PM5jvValFkbFH3TV]{Mounts} or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command an Animal} action while riding the monster.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The triggering creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the listed DC or fall off the creature and land @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}. If the save is a critical failure, the triggering creature also takes [[/roll 1d6[bludgeoning]]]{1d6 bludgeoning damage} in addition to the normal damage for the fall.</p>",
          "CatchRock": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster must have a free hand but can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.wQYmDStjdjn0I26t]{Release} anything it's holding as part of this reaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The monster is targeted with a thrown rock Strike or a rock would fall on the monster.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its AC against the triggering attack or to any defense against the falling rock. If the attack misses or the monster successfully defends against the falling rock, the monster catches the rock, takes no damage, and is now holding the rock</p>",
          "ChangeShape": "<p>The monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.AJstokjdG6iDjVjE]{Impersonate} use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block.</p>",
          "ConstantSpells": "<p>A constant spell affects the monster without the monster needing to cast it, and its duration is unlimited. If a constant spell gets counteracted, the monster can reactivate it by spending the normal spellcasting actions the spell requires.</p>",
          "Constrict": "<p>The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC.</p>",
          "Coven": "<p>This monster can form a coven with two or more other creatures who also have the coven ability. This involves performing an 8-hour ceremony with all prospective coven members. After the coven is formed, each of its members gains elite adjustments, adjusting their levels accordingly. Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.</p>\n<p>Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single-action spellcasting activity that has a single verbal component. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens grant the 8th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.dN8QBNuTiaBHCKUe]{Baleful Polymorph}</em> spell and all the following spells, which the coven can cast at any level up to 5th: <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.41TZEjhO6D1nWw2X]{Augury}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6]{Charm}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.HXhWYJviWalN5tQ2]{Clairaudience}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.zvKWclOZ7A53DObE]{Clairvoyance}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.yM3KTTSAIHhyuP14]{Dream Message}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ucf8eynbZMfUucjE]{Illusory Scene}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ek5XI0aEdZhBgm21]{Prying Eye}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.FM3SmEW8N1FCRjqt]{Talking Corpse}</em>. Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join. A coven can also cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XkDCzMIyc0YOjw05]{Control Weather}</em> ritual, with a DC of 23 instead of the standard DC.</p>\n<p>If a coven member leaving the coven or the death of a coven member brings the coven below three members, the remaining members keep their elite adjustments for 24 hours, but without enough members to contribute the necessary actions, they can't cast coven spells.</p>",
          "Darkvision": "<p>A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4GE2ZdODgIQtg51c]{Darkness}</em> spell, block normal darkvision. A monster with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.4Ho2xMPEC05aSxzr]{Greater Darkvision}, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.</p>",
          "Disease": "<p>When a creature is exposed to a monster's disease, it attempts a Fortitude save or succumbs to the disease. The level of a disease is the level of the monster inflicting the disease. The disease follows the rules for afflictions.</p>",
          "Engulf": "<p>The monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any creature of the monster's size or smaller whose space the monster moves through can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the monster's path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of the monster's movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.</p>\n<p>A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster's body. It is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}, is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating. The creature takes the listed amount of damage when first engulfed and at the end of each of its turns while it's engulfed. An engulfed creature can get free by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escaping} against the listed escape DC. An engulfed creature can attack the monster engulfing it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The engulfing creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the engulfed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either method can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p>\n<p>If the monster dies, all creatures it has engulfed are automatically released as the monster's form loses cohesion.</p>",
          "FastHealing": "<p>A monster with this ability regains the given number of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn.</p>",
          "Ferocity": "<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The monster is reduced to 0 HP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster avoids being knocked out and remains at 1 HP, but its @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Yl48xTdMh3aeQYL2]{Wounded} value increases by 1. When it is Wounded 3, it can no longer use this ability</p>",
          "FormUp": "<p>The troop chooses one of the squares it currently occupies and redistributes its squares to any configuration in which all squares are contiguous and within 15 feet of the chosen square. The troop can't share its space with other creatures.</p>",
          "FrightfulPresence": "<p>A creature that first enters the area must attempt a Will save.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to this monster's Frightful Presence for 1 minute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected by the presence.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 1}.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 2}.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TBSHQspnbcqxsmjL]{Frightened 4}.</p>",
          "Grab": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster's last action was a success with a Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or it has a creature grabbed using this action.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster automatically Grabs the target until the end of the monster's next turn. The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} by whichever body part the monster attacked with, and that body part can't be used to Strike creatures until the grab is ended. Using Grab extends the duration of the monster's Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it. A grabbed creature can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the monster moves away from it.</p>",
          "GreaterConstrict": "<p>The monster deals the listed amount of damage to any number of creatures @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.VcDeM8A5oI6VqhbM]{Restrained} by it. Each of those creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with the listed DC. A creature that fails this save falls @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}, and a creature that succeeds is then temporarily immune to falling unconscious from Greater Constrict for 1 minute.</p>",
          "GreaterDarkvision": "<p>A creature with greater darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only. Some forms of magical darkness, such as a 4th-level <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4GE2ZdODgIQtg51c]{Darkness}</em> spell, block normal @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.qCCLZhnp2HhP3Ex6]{Darkvision}. A creature with greater darkvision, however, can see through even these forms of magical darkness.</p>",
          "ImprovedGrab": "<p>The monster can use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.Tkd8sH4pwFIPzqTr]{Grab} as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack. A monster with Improved Grab still needs to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it already has @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}.</p>",

          "Lifesense": "<p>Lifesense allows a monster to sense the vital essence of living and undead creatures within the listed range. The sense can distinguish between the positive energy animating living creatures and the negative energy animating undead creatures, much as sight distinguishes colors.</p>",
          "LightBlindness": "<p>When first exposed to bright light, the monster is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.XgEqL1kFApUbl5Z2]{Blinded} until the end of its next turn. After this exposure, light doesn't blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in darkness.

          "LowLightVision": "<p>The monster can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so it ignores the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} condition due to dim light.</p>",
          "NegativeHealing": "<p>A creature with negative healing draws health from negative energy rather than positive energy. It is damaged by positive damage and is not healed by positive healing effects. It does not take negative damage, and it is healed by negative effects that heal undead.</p>",
          "Poison": "<p>When a creature is exposed to a monster's poison, it attempts a Fortitude save to avoid becoming poisoned. The level of a poison is the level of the monster inflicting the poison. The poison follows the rules for afflictions.</p>",
          "PowerAttack": "<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per round</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster makes a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating the monster's multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, the monster deals an extra die of weapon damage.</p>",
          "Push": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The monster's last action was a success with a Strike that lists Push in its damage entry.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster automatically knocks the target away from the monster.

          "Scent": "<p>Scent involves sensing creatures or objects by smell, and is usually a vague sense. The range is listed in the ability, and it functions only if the creature or object being detected emits an aroma (for instance, incorporeal creatures usually do not exude an aroma).</p>\n<p>If a creature emits a heavy aroma or is upwind, the GM can double or even triple the range of scent abilities used to detect that creature, and the GM can reduce the range if a creature is downwind.</p>",
          "ShieldBlock": "<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The monster has its shield raised and takes damage from a physical attack.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster snaps its shield into place to deflect a blow.

          "SwallowWhole": "<p>The monster attempts to swallow a creature of the listed size or smaller that it has grabbed in its jaws or mouth. If a swallowed creature is of the maximum size listed, the monster can't use Swallow Whole again. If the creature is smaller than the maximum, the monster can usually swallow more creatures; the GM determines the maximum. The monster attempts an @Check[type:athletics|defense:reflex] check opposed by the grabbed creature's Reflex DC. If it succeeds, it swallows the creature. The monster's mouth or jaws no longer grab a creature it has swallowed, so the monster is free to use them to Strike or Grab once again. The monster can't attack creatures it has swallowed.</p>\n<p>A swallowed creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.kWc1fhmv9LBiTuei]{Grabbed}, is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, and has to hold its breath or start suffocating.

If the victim @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escapes} this ability's grabbed condition, it exits through the monster's mouth. This frees any other creature grabbed in the monster's mouth or jaws. A swallowed creature can attack the monster that has swallowed it, but only with unarmed attacks or with weapons of light Bulk or less. The swallowing creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against the attack. If the monster takes piercing or slashing damage equaling or exceeding the listed Rupture value from a single attack or spell, the swallowed creature cuts itself free. A creature that gets free by either Escaping or cutting itself free can immediately breathe and exits the swallowing monster's space.</p>\n<p>If the monster dies, a swallowed creature can be freed by creatures adjacent to the corpse if they spend a combined total of 3 actions cutting the monster open with a weapon or unarmed attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.</p>",
          "SwarmMind": "<p>This monster doesn't have a single mind (typically because it's a swarm of smaller creatures), and is immune to mental effects that target only a specific number of creatures. It is still subject to mental effects that affect all creatures in an area.</p>",
          "Telepathy": "<p>A monster with telepathy can communicate mentally with any creatures within the listed radius, as long as they share a language. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.</p>",

          "Trample": "<p>The monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of creatures of the listed size, Trampling each creature whose space it enters. The monster can attempt to Trample the same creature only once in a single use of Trample. The monster deals the damage of the listed Strike, but trampled creatures can attempt a basic Reflex save at the listed DC (no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, double damage on a critical failure).</p>",
          "Tremorsense": "<p>Tremorsense allows a monster to feel the vibrations through a solid surface caused by movement. It is an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Tremorsense functions only if the monster is on the same surface as the subject, and only if the subject is moving along (or burrowing through) the surface.</p>",
          "TroopDefenses": "<p>Troops are composed of many individuals, and over the course of enough attacks and downed comrades, troops shrink in size. Most troops start with 16 squares (4 by 4), and their Hit Points have two listed thresholds, typically the first is at 2/3 their maximum Hit Points and the second is at 1/3 their maximum Hit Points. Once the troop drops below the first threshold, it loses 4 squares, leaving 12 squares remaining, and the first threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. Once the troop falls below the second threshold, it loses another 4 squares, leaving 8 squares remaining, and the second threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. In order to restore its size and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen. At 0 Hit Points, the troop is reduced down to 4 squares, which is too few to sustain the troop, so it disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, fleeing, or easily dispatched, depending on their nature.</p>\n<p>A damaging single-target effect, such as a Strike, can't force a troop to pass through more than one threshold at once. For instance, if a troop had 60 Hit Points, with thresholds at 40 and 20, a Strike for 50 damage would leave the troop at 21 Hit Points, just above the second threshold. A damaging area effect or multi-target effect can cross multiple thresholds at once and could potentially destroy the entire troop in one shot.</p>\n<p>Non-damaging effects with an area or that target all creatures in a certain proximity affect a troop normally if they affect the entire area occupied by the troop. If an effect has a smaller area or numbers of targets, it typically has no effect on the troop. However, if the effect can target at least four creatures or cover at least four squares in the troop, and if it would prevent its targets from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more, the troop loses loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount required to bring it to the next threshold, removing 4 squares. If an effect would both deal damage and automatically cross a threshold due to incapacitating some of the creatures in the troop, apply the damage first. If the damage wasn't enough to cross a threshold on its own, then reduce the Hit Points to cross the threshold for the incapacitating effect.</p>",
          "Wavesense": "<p>This sense allows a monster to feel vibrations caused by movement through a liquid. It's an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability).

    "PreciousMaterialAbysium": "Abysium",
    "PreciousMaterialAbysiumDescription": "A blue-green metal with an eerie green luminescence, abysium radiates power that's inimical to life. Careless exposure to the material can lead to long-term damage to the immune system; as such, mining abysium is hazardous, as large quantities of the metal in an area cause all nearby creatures to become sick. A creature carrying an abysium object is sickened 1 for a standard-grade object of light Bulk, sickened 2 for a standard-grade object of 1 Bulk or more or a high-grade object of light Bulk, or sickened 3 for a high-grade object of 1 Bulk or more. This and all other sickening effects of abysium are poison effects. Crafters can use 1 abysium chunk to create up to 6 doses of poisonous abysium powder. Unscrupulous smiths have harnessed abysium's toxic properties to create noxious weapons and deadly substances. All objects crafted from abysium shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.",
    "PreciousMaterialAdamantine": "Adamantine",
    "PreciousMaterialAdamantineDescription": "Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, adamantine is one of the hardest metals known. It has a shiny, black appearance, and it is prized for its amazing resiliency and ability to hold an incredibly sharp edge.",
    "PreciousMaterialColdIron": "Cold Iron",
    "PreciousMaterialColdIronDescription": "Weapons made from cold iron are deadly to demons and fey alike. Cold iron looks like normal iron but is mined from particularly pure sources and shaped with little or no heat. This process is extremely difficult, especially for high-grade cold iron items.",
    "PreciousMaterialDarkwood": "Darkwood",
    "PreciousMaterialDarkwoodDescription": "Darkwood is a very lightweight wood found primarily in old- growth forests in south-central Avistan; it is dark as ebony but has a slight purple tint. A darkwood item's Bulk is reduced by 1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of darkwood is based on the item's normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of darkwood, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.",
    "PreciousMaterialDjezet": "Djezet",
    "PreciousMaterialDjezetDescription": "This rust red metal is liquid at room temperature, making it challenging for all but the most skilled metallurgists to craft with and earning it the name \"quickiron\" in some places. Djezet is also extremely reactive to magic, even in its solid, workable alloyed form. It glows when targeted by magic, and objects crafted with djezet alloys glow with scarlet striations, which lead some smiths to nickname it \"tiger iron.\" When targeted by spells, objects crafted from djezet alloys exhibit these glowing red markings that last for 1 round or the duration of the spell, whichever is longer. A djezet mass contains enough djezet to refine into up to two djezet doses.",
    "PreciousMaterialDragonhide": "Dragonhide",
    "PreciousMaterialDragonhideDescription": "The hide and scales of a dragon can be used to Craft any item normally made of ordinary leather or hide. Dragonhide varies in color from blue to glittering gold, depending on the dragon it came from. Due to the scales' resiliency, it can also be used to Craft armor usually made out of metal plates (such as a breastplate, half plate, and full plate), allowing such armor to be made without metal. Dragonhide objects are immune to one damage type, depending on the type of dragon.",
    "PreciousMaterialGradeLabel": "Precious Material Grade",
    "PreciousMaterialGrisantianPelt": "Grisantian Pelt",
    "PreciousMaterialGrisantianPeltDescription": "This supernaturally tough animal skin is gold and shines in sunlight. It can be used to make any item usually made of cloth, leather, or hide. This material is immune to fire, and its Hardness is doubled against piercing or slashing damage. Up to 4 Bulk of grisantian pelt can be harvested from a single creature (this is usually more than enough for 4 suits of standard grade armor or 2 suit of high-grade armor).",
    "PreciousMaterialHighGrade": "High-Grade",
    "PreciousMaterialInubrix": "Inubrix",
    "PreciousMaterialInubrixDescription": "This pale, malleable metal's unusual molecular structure allows it to partially pass through iron and steel without touching them. While this property is useful for making weapons that bypass metal armor, inubrix is barely sturdier than lead. Even in an alloyed state, this skymetal is so fragile that it's difficult to use in crafting reliable shields and less than ideal for crafting armor.",
    "PreciousMaterialLabel": "Precious Material",
    "PreciousMaterialLowGrade": "Low-Grade",
    "PreciousMaterialKeepStone": "Keep Stone",
    "PreciousMaterialKeepStoneDescription": "The crowning achievement of Highhelm's millennia of metallurgical advancements and engineering is the beautiful alloy called keep stone. Despite its name, no stone is used in the production of keep stone. Through the use of a highly guarded process that smelts together adamantine and lead, Highhelm's greatest crafters were able to develop a material with an appearance that more closely resembles marble than metal. Keep stone is only slightly weaker than adamantine alone, but with the incredible ability to disrupt magic. Any spell or magical effect targeting raw keep stone must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the effect is lost.",
    "PreciousMaterialMithral": "Mithral",
    "PreciousMaterialMithralDescription": "Mithral is renowned for its lightness, durability, and effectiveness against a range of creatures including devils and lycanthropes. It has the same sheen as silver but a slightly lighter hue. Mithral weapons and armor are treated as if they were silver for the purpose of damaging creatures with weakness to silver. A metal item made of mithral is lighter than one made of iron or steel: the item's Bulk is reduced by 1 (reduced to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of this material is based on the item's normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of mithral, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.",
    "PreciousMaterialNoqual": "Noqual",
    "PreciousMaterialNoqualDescription": "Light and strong, noqual also demonstrates a powerful resistance to magic. A side effect of this resistance is that making magical weapons out of noqual requires complex and expensive alchemical treatments. Kevoth-Kul, the Black Sovereign of Numeria, has developed an alloy of noqual and cold iron known as sovereign steel to help mitigate this property. The metal's crystalline appearance might suggest that it's fragile, but the pale-green material can be worked similarly to iron. Objects made of noqual have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item attempts and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the rusting grasp spell).",
    "PreciousMaterialOrichalcum": "Orichalcum",
    "PreciousMaterialOrichalcumDescription": "The most rare and valuable skymetal, orichalcum is coveted for its incredible time-related magical properties. This dull, coppery metal isn't as physically sturdy as adamantine, but orichalcum's time-bending properties protect it, granting it greater Hardness and Hit Points. If an orichalcum item takes damage but isn't destroyed, it repairs itself completely 24 hours later.",
    "PreciousMaterialPeachwood": "Peachwood",
    "PreciousMaterialPeachwoodDescription": "Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight. Peachwood is treated as darkwood for any undead creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to darkwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a jiang-shi's resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. Strikes with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standard-grade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.",
    "PreciousMaterialSiccatite": "Siccatite",
    "PreciousMaterialSiccatiteDescription": "In its raw state, this silvery ore is either scalding hot or freezing cold. Metallurgists disagree over whether siccatite is two related substances or one substance that determines its temperature output via some unknown process. Whatever the reason, the extreme temperature of the material means it must be handled carefully. Hot siccatite can easily ignite flammables such as paper and dry brush, and cold siccatite left in moist areas quickly surrounds itself with a thick layer of ice. A creature that comes into physical contact with a significant amount of siccatite takes 1 energy Damage for each round of continued contact (either fire or cold damage, for hot and cold siccatite respectively).",
    "PreciousMaterialSilver": "Silver",
    "PreciousMaterialSilverDescription": "Silver weapons are a bane to creatures ranging from devils to werewolves. Silver items are less durable than steel items, and low-grade silver items are usually merely silver-plated.",
    "PreciousMaterialSisterstone": "Sisterstone",
    "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneDescription": "Sisterstone is a term used for two closely related ores infused by the spiritual runoff in the Field of Maidens, dusk sisterstone and scarlet sisterstone. They have the same physical properties except for color-dusk sisterstone is a pale orange while scarlet sisterstone is orange-red. When near an object made of the other type of sisterstone, they both begin exuding spiritual energy that repels undead.",
    "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneDusk": "Sisterstone (Dusk)",
    "PreciousMaterialSisterstoneScarlet": "Sisterstone (Scarlet)",
    "PreciousMaterialSovereignSteel": "Sovereign Steel",
    "PreciousMaterialSovereignSteelDescription": "Created by Black Sovereign Kevoth-Kul, this unique alloy of cold iron and the skymetal noqual can provide protection from magical assault. The process of cold-forging the two materials together is quite complicated and precise. Characters in search of sovereign steel weapons and armor will almost assuredly have to travel to Starfall to procure gear made from this rare alloy. While some believe it possible to craft shields of sovereign steel as well, in one of his fits, Kevoth-Kul yelled that he had no use for them and banned anyone from making such a thing. So far, his smiths have been too afraid to confirm whether or not it was a joke. All sovereign steel items (including weapon and armor below) have a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against magic that the item makes, and grant their bonus to saves the owner makes specifically to protect the item from magic (such as against the rusting grasp spell).",
    "PreciousMaterialStandardGrade": "Standard-Grade",
    "PreciousMaterialWarpglass": "Warpglass",
    "PreciousMaterialWarpglassDescription": "This bizarre substance is fashioned from the raw, chaotic quintessence of the Maelstrom. It can be fashioned into weapons and items, but is too unstable to make into useful armor or shields. Raw warpglass is an opalescent glassy material with surprising strength. When worked, it changes its appearance-though not its properties-to appear as random striations of other metals and types of stone.",

    "TraitDescriptionAdditive": "Feats with the additive trait allow you to spend actions to add special substances to bombs or elixirs. You can add only one additive to a single alchemical item, and attempting to add another spoils the item. You can typically use actions with the additive trait only when you're creating an infused alchemical item, and some can be used only with the Quick Alchemy action. The additive trait is always followed by a level, such as additive 2. An additive adds its level to the level of the alchemical item you're modifying; the result is the new level of the mixture. The mixture's item level must be no higher than your advanced alchemy level",
    "TraitDescriptionAdjusted": "The equipment comes with an adjustment described in its entry. This adjustment is built into the equipment permanently, meaning the equipment can't have another adjustment added, nor can it be swapped out for a different adjustment. If the adjustment alters the item's base statistics, such as adding the noisy trait, that's reflected in the equipment's table entry.",
    "TraitDescriptionAdjustment": "Items with this trait are intended to alter existing pieces of equipment, typically armors, shields, and weapons.

    "TraitDescriptionAeon": "These monitors are the self-styled defenders of reality.

    "TraitDescriptionAlchemist": "This indicates abilities from the alchemist class.",

    "TraitDescriptionApex": "When you Invest an Item that has the apex trait, it improves one of your attribute modifiers, either increasing it by 1 or to a total of +4, whichever grants the higher modifier. This gives you all the benefits of the new attribute modifier until the investiture ends. An apex item grants this benefit only the first time it's invested within a 24-hour period, and you can benefit from only one apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item when you already have one invested, you don't gain the attribute modifier increase, though you do gain any other effects of Investing the Item.",
    "TraitDescriptionAphorite": "A type of planar scion descended from a being from Axis, the Plane of Law.",

An attached weapon is usually bolted onto or built into the item it's attached to, and typically an item can have only one weapon attached to it. An attached weapon can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful @Check[type:crafting|dc:10] check; this includes the time needed to remove the weapon from a previous item, if necessary. If an item is destroyed, its attached weapon can usually be salvaged.",
    "TraitDescriptionAttack": "An ability with this trait involves an attack. For each attack you make beyond the first on your turn, you take a multiple attack penalty.",
    "TraitDescriptionAuditory": "Auditory actions and effects rely on sound. An action with the auditory trait can be successfully performed only if the creature using the action can speak or otherwise produce the required sounds. A spell or effect with the auditory trait has its effect only if the target can hear it. This applies only to sound-based parts of the effect, as determined by the GM. This is different from a sonic effect, which still affects targets who can't hear it (such as deaf targets) as long as the effect itself makes sound.",

    "TraitDescriptionBarding": "You can purchase special armor for animals, called barding. All animals have a trained proficiency rank in light barding, and combat-trained animals are trained in heavy barding. Barding uses the same rules as armor except for the following.

Barding can't be etched with magic runes, though special magical barding might be available.",
    "TraitDescriptionBeastkin": "Humanoids that can partially or fully transform into animal forms.",

    "TraitDescriptionBrutal": "A ranged attack with this trait uses its Strength modifier instead of Dexterity on the attack roll.",

    "TraitDescriptionCapacity": "Weapons that have the capacity trait typically have multiple barrels or chambers capable of containing a round of ammunition.

Each barrel or chamber can be reloaded after it's fired as a separate Interact action.",
    "TraitDescriptionCatalyst": "Items with the catalyst trait are consumable material spell components that alter or magnify specific spells. Activating a catalyst is part of Casting the Spell. The catalyst might increase the number of actions required to Cast the Spell, as indicated in the catalyst's Activate entry.

Because the catalyst becomes part of the material components, you can draw the catalyst as part of Casting the Spell.",
    "TraitDescriptionCatfolk": "A creature with this trait is a member of the catfolk ancestry.",
    "TraitDescriptionCenser": "Censers are decorative containers, often metal or ceramic, in which incense is burned. An item with the censer trait must be filled with incense to Activate it, which ignites the incense and causes the censer to exude a cloud of smoke.",

You can select a class archetype only if your class meets the criteria listed in the archetype's prerequisites. Class archetypes always alter or replace some of a class's static class features in addition to any new feats they offer. It might be possible to take a class archetype at 1st level if it alters or replaces some of the class's initial class features. The 1st-level ability is presented much like a class feature and includes the class archetype's prerequisites and rules on how it changes your class. If you select this ability, you must take that archetype's dedication feat at 2nd level, and you proceed normally afterward. You can never have more than one class archetype.",

    "TraitDescriptionCoda": "<p>Instruments with the coda trait work mostly like staves and have the staff trait. There are two differences: Coda instruments are in the form of musical instruments, and they can be prepared only by bards. Because they're not physically staves, you can't attack with a coda instrument, nor can you etch it with weapon runes.</p><p>The process of preparing a coda instrument involves playing significant portions of songs related to the spells within the instrument—either old standards or ones of your own creation. This leaves magical reverberations within the instrument that allow you to complete the songs by playing their coda later in the day.</p>",

If the spell includes a verbal component, you must use an auditory performance, and if it includes a somatic component, you must use a visual one.

    "TraitDescriptionCriticalFusion": "Critical fusion is a new trait for combination weapons that grants you two additional options for the critical specialization effect when using the combination weapon's melee version to make a melee attack while the firearm is loaded. If you choose to use one of them, they replace the melee usage's normal critical specialization effect. First, you can discharge the firearm to create a loud bang and concussion, using the critical specialization effect for firearms instead of the melee weapon group's critical specialization effect. Second, you can choose to discharge the firearm to increase the critical hit's momentum or shoot the foe as you attack them in melee, dealing 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Both of these options discharge the firearm, which typically means you have to reload it before firing it again.",
    "TraitDescriptionCurse": "A curse is an effect that places some long-term affliction on a creature. Curses are always magical and are typically the result of a spell or trap. Effects with this trait can be removed only by effects that specifically target curses.",

A curse isn't detected when the item is identified, though a critical success reveals both the presence and exact nature of the curse. Cursed items can't be discarded once they've been triggered or invested the first time. The item can be removed only if the curse is removed.",
    "TraitDescriptionDarkness": "Darkness effects extinguish non-magical light in the area, and can counteract less powerful magical light.

This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking rune and three dice if the weapon has a major striking rune.

An ability that changes the size of the weapon's normal damage dice doesn't change the size of its deadly die.",

However, if you use both hands, the weapon can make fatal attacks. When you wield the weapon in two hands, it gains the fatal trait with the listed damage die.

It can be affixed to an item with 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 10 Crafting check; this includes the time needed to remove the shield from a previous gauntlet, if necessary. If the gauntlet is destroyed, the foldaway shield can usually be salvaged. The collapsible nature of the shield makes it impossible to affix an attached weapon to it.</p>",
    "TraitDescriptionForce": "Effects with this trait deal force damage or create objects made of pure magical force.",
    "TraitDescriptionForceful": "This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each subsequent attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.",
    "TraitDescriptionFortune": "A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
    "TraitDescriptionFreeHand": "This weapon doesn't take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can't be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can't attack with a free-hand weapon if you're wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you're not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.",
    "TraitDescriptionFulu": "Fulus are small paper charms that can be affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, a weapon, a creature, or even a structure. Some fulus are composed of multiple such charms, taking effect only once all have been affixed. Normal fulus have effects immediately once affixed, while fulu talismans have an effect only once activated. Once a fulu has been activated, it lasts for the given duration and then burns out. Unless otherwise noted, fulus expire one year after being created, reverting to mundane paper. All fulus have the fulu and consumable traits. Fulus also have a tradition trait—either arcane, divine, occult or primal—determined by the magical tradition of its creator. For example, a fulu created by a priest would have the divine trait, whereas a witch who dabbles in fate might create a fulu with the occult trait. Some fulus also have the talisman trait, if they work similarly to talismans (such as being affixed to a suit of armor, a shield, or a weapon. Each fulu's stat block indicates the type of item or creature it can be affixed to. Affixing or removing a fulu requires using the Affix a Fulu activity, or the Affix a Talisman action instead if the fulu is also a talisman.",
    "TraitDescriptionGadget": "Gadgets are consumable technological inventions with innovative uses.",
    "TraitDescriptionGanzi": "A planar scion descended from a chaotic being of the Maelstrom, such as a protean.",
    "TraitDescriptionGeneral": "A type of feat that any character can select, regardless of ancestry and class, as long as they meet the prerequisites. You can select a feat with this trait when your class grants a general feat.",
    "TraitDescriptionGenie": "The diverse families of genies hold positions of prominence on the Elemental Planes. They have powerful magical abilities.",
    "TraitDescriptionGeniekin": "An umbrella term for planar scions descended from beings from the Elemental Planes.",

    "TraitDescriptionGnome": "A creature with this trait is a member of the gnome ancestry. Gnomes are small people skilled at magic who seek out new experiences and usually have low-light vision. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by gnomes. A weapon with this trait is created and used by gnomes.",
    "TraitDescriptionGoblin": "A creature with this trait can come from multiple tribes of creatures, including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. Goblins tend to have darkvision. An ability with this trait can be used or chosen only by goblins. A weapon with this trait is created and used by goblins.",
    "TraitDescriptionGoloma": "Insular humanoids that bear countless eyes.",
    "TraitDescriptionGood": "Good effects often manipulate energy from good-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to evil divine servants or divine servants of evil deities. A creature with this trait is good in alignment.",
    "TraitDescriptionGrapple": "You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
    "TraitDescriptionGrimoire": "Spellbooks are useful tools for any magic user to write down incantations and runes of power, but where most spellbooks are nothing more than ink on parchment, grimoires have absorbed the magic of the spells within—magic that knowledgeable spellcasters can use to augment their spells.",
    "TraitDescriptionGrippli": "Gripplis are a family of frog-like humanoids",
    "TraitDescriptionGunslinger": "This indicates abilities from the gunslinger class.",
    "TraitDescriptionHalfElf": "A creature with this trait is part human and part elf. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by half-elves.",
    "TraitDescriptionHalfOrc": "A creature with this trait is part human and part orc. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by half-orcs.",

    "TraitDescriptionHampering": "A weapon with the hampering trait includes a disruptive limb or flange. You can use an Interact action to thrash the weapon in a square within the weapon's reach. That square becomes difficult terrain until you attack with the weapon, move, would otherwise stop thrashing it, or at the beginning of your next turn.",
    "TraitDescriptionHarnessed": "This shield features a special brace or opening designed to hold jousting weapons.",
    "TraitDescriptionHaunt": "A hazard with this trait is a spiritual echo, often of someone with a tragic death. Putting a haunt to rest often involves resolving the haunt's unfinished business. A haunt that hasn't been properly put to rest always returns after a time.",
    "TraitDescriptionHealing": "A healing effect restores a creature's body, typically by restoring Hit Points, but sometimes by removing diseases or other debilitating effects.",
    "TraitDescriptionHefty": "A hefty shield is so heavy that raising it takes more effort. Raising a Shield with the hefty trait is a 2-action activity unless your Strength score equals or exceeds the number with the trait.",
    "TraitDescriptionHex": "A hex is a type of focus spell a witch can cast.",
    "TraitDescriptionHindering": "This armor is so heavy and bulky it slows you down no matter what. You take a -5 penalty to all your Speeds (to a minimum of a 5-foot Speed). This is separate from and in addition to the armor's Speed penalty, and affects you even if your Strength or an ability lets you reduce or ignore the armor's Speed penalty.",
    "TraitDescriptionHobgolin": "Hobgoblins are a sturdy, clever people with a propensity for militaristic order.",
    "TraitDescriptionHuman": "A creature with this trait is a member of the human ancestry. Humans are a diverse array of people known for their adaptability. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by humans.",
    "TraitDescriptionHumanoid": "Humanoid creatures reason and act much like humans. They typically stand upright and have two arms and two legs.",
    "TraitDescriptionIfrit": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Fire.",
    "TraitDescriptionIllusion": "Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the illusion school of magic, typically involving false sensory stimuli.",
    "TraitDescriptionImpulse": "The primary magical actions kineticists use are called impulses. You can use an impulse only if your kinetic aura is active and channeling that element, and only if you have a hand free to shape the elemental flow. The impulse trait means the action has the concentrate trait unless another ability changes this. If an impulse allows you to choose an element, you can choose any element you're channeling, and the impulse gains that element's trait.",
    "TraitDescriptionIncapacitation": "An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it's harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell's level treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.",
    "TraitDescriptionIncarnate": "A spell with the incarnate trait is similar in theme to spells that summon creatures, but it doesn't conjure a minion with the summoned trait. Instead, when summoned, the incarnate creature takes its Arrive action when you finish Casting the Spell. At the end of your next turn, the incarnate creature can either Step, Stride, or take the action for another movement type it has (such as Climb or Burrow), and then takes its Depart action. The spell then ends. The names of specific Arrive and Depart actions are listed in italics after the word “Arrive” or “Depart” respectively, along with any traits. A creature summoned by an incarnate spell acts in your interests, directs its effects away from you and your allies as much as possible, and might listen to your requests, but ultimately makes its own decisions. If the spell indicates that the incarnate makes a decision, the GM determines what the incarnate would do. It might even become more inclined to do precisely as you wish over multiple summonings. The incarnate is not fully a creature. It can't take any other actions, nor can it be targeted or harmed by Strikes, spells, or other effects unless they would be able to target or end a spell effect (such as dispel magic). It has a size for the purposes of determining its placement for effects, but it doesn't block movement. If applicable, its effects use your spell DCs and spell attack roll modifier.",
    "TraitDescriptionIncorporeal": "An incorporeal creature or object has no physical form. It can pass through solid objects, including walls. When inside an object, an incorporeal creature can't perceive, attack, or interact with anything outside the object, and if it starts its turn in an object, it is slowed 1. Corporeal creatures can pass through an incorporeal creature, but they can't end their movement in its space. An incorporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against physical creatures or objects-only against incorporeal ones-unless those objects have the ghost touch property rune. Likewise, a corporeal creature can't attempt Strength-based checks against incorporeal creatures or objects. Incorporeal creatures usually have immunity to effects or conditions that require a physical body, like disease, poison, and precision damage. They usually have resistance against all damage (except force damage and damage from Strikes with the ghost touch property rune), with double the resistance against non-magical damage.",
    "TraitDescriptionInfused": "You created an alchemical item with the infused trait using your infused reagents, and it has a limited time before it becomes inert. Any nonpermanent effects from your infused alchemical items, with the exception of afflictions such as slow-acting poisons, end when you make your daily preparations again.",
    "TraitDescriptionInfusion": "Actions with the infusion trait tweak your kineticist impulses. You must use an infusion action directly before the impulse action you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than an impulse action directly after, you waste the benefits of the infusion action. Any additional effects added by an infusion action are part of the impulse's effect, not of the infusion action itself.",
    "TraitDescriptionIngested": "This poison is delivered when drunk or eaten.",
    "TraitDescriptionInhaled": "This poison is delivered when breathed in.",
    "TraitDescriptionInjection": "This weapon can be filled with an injury poison. Immediately after a successful attack with the weapon, you can inject the target with the loaded poison with a single Interact action. Refilling the weapon with a new substance requires three Interact actions, and uses both hands.",
    "TraitDescriptionInjury": "This poison is delivered by damaging the recipient.",
    "TraitDescriptionInscribed": "The armor or shield has been treated so it can be inscribed with magical symbols using the same method as Crafting a scroll. Inscribed attire can hold one scroll inscribed on it. You need a free hand to Activate the scroll, but you don't need to Interact to draw it. You can also Activate the magic to erase the scroll the armor currently contains. You can't inscribe a new scroll onto the armor if a scroll is currently inscribed on it or if the armor is broken.",
    "TraitDescriptionIntegrated": "This shield has been created to include a weapon in its construction, which works like an attached weapon but can't be removed from the shield.",
    "TraitDescriptionIntelligent": "An item with this trait is intelligent and has its own will and personality, as well as several statistics that most items don't have. Intelligent items can't be crafted by normal means, and they are always rare or unique.",
    "TraitDescriptionInventor": "This indicates abilities from the inventor class.",
    "TraitDescriptionInvested": "A character can wear only 10 magical items that have the invested trait. None of the magical effects of the item apply if the character hasn't invested it, nor can it be activated, though the character still gains any normal benefits from wearing the physical item (like a hat keeping rain off their head).",
    "TraitDescriptionInvestigator": "This indicates abilities from the investigator class.",
    "TraitDescriptionJousting": "The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value.",
    "TraitDescriptionKashrishi": "A stout ancestry bearing distinctive crystal horns and inherent psychic abilities.",
    "TraitDescriptionKickback": "A kickback weapon is extra powerful and difficult to use due to its high recoil. A kickback weapon deals 1 additional damage with all attacks. Firing a kickback weapon gives a -2 circumstance penalty to the attack roll, but characters with 14 or more Strength ignore the penalty. Attaching a kickback weapon to a deployed bipod, tripod, or other stabilizer can lower or negate this penalty.",
    "TraitDescriptionKineticist": "This indicates abilities from the kineticist class.",
    "TraitDescriptionKitsune": "Shapeshifting humanoids whose true forms resemble foxes.",
    "TraitDescriptionKobold": "A creature with this trait is a member of the kobold ancestry.",
    "TraitDescriptionLaminar": "The armor is made up of layered sections, so when it breaks, it isn't as much of a problem. The status penalty to AC if this armor is broken is –1 for broken medium armor, –2 for broken heavy armor, or no penalty for broken light armor.",
    "TraitDescriptionLaunching": "A mechanism within this shield can shoot projectiles, causing the shield to also function as a ranged weapon. The trait lists the type of weapon, such as \"launching dart.\" Striking with the launcher requires the same number of hands as normal, except that the hand holding the shield counts toward this total, so a one-handed ranged weapon would require only one hand. Reloading takes the normal number of Interact actions, to a minimum of 1 action, and you can't use the hand holding your shield to reload.",
    "TraitDescriptionLawful": "Lawful effects often manipulate energy from law-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to chaotic divine servants or divine servants of chaotic deities. A creature with this trait is lawful in alignment.",
    "TraitDescriptionLeshy": "A creature with this trait is a member of the leshy ancestry.",
    "TraitDescriptionLight": "Light effects overcome non-magical darkness in the area, and can counteract magical darkness. You must usually target darkness magic with your light magic directly to counteract the darkness, but some light spells automatically attempt to counteract darkness.",
    "TraitDescriptionLinguistic": "An effect with this trait depends on language comprehension. A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.",
    "TraitDescriptionLitany": "Litanies are special devotion spells, typically used by champions and requiring a single action, that usually give temporary immunity to further litanies.",
    "TraitDescriptionLizardfolk": "These reptilian humanoids, also known as iruxi, are extremely adaptable and patient.",
    "TraitDescriptionLozenge": "You Activate an alchemical lozenge by putting it in your mouth. It stays there, slowly dissolving and releasing its ingredients over time. You can bite a lozenge for a secondary effect. The action this takes is noted in the item. As soon as this secondary effect is over, the lozenge is used up and its benefits for you end. You can drink elixirs, potions, and beverages with a lozenge in your mouth, but you can't benefit from more than one lozenge at a time. If you have two lozenges in your mouth at the same time, both become inert. You can also spit out a lozenge as a single action to end its effect and make it inert. A lozenge dissolves due to its alchemical ingredients, so it typically still works even if you don't have saliva.",
    "TraitDescriptionMagical": "Something with the magical trait is imbued with magical energies not tied to a specific tradition of magic. A magical item radiates a magic aura infused with its dominant school of magic. Some items or effects are closely tied to a particular tradition of magic. In these cases, the item has the arcane, divine, occult, or primal trait instead of the magical trait. Any of these traits indicate that the item is magical.",
    "TraitDescriptionMagus": "This indicates abilities from the magus class.",
    "TraitDescriptionManipulate": "You must physically manipulate an item or make gestures to use an action with this trait. Creatures without a suitable appendage can't perform actions with this trait. Manipulate actions often trigger reactions.",
    "TraitDescriptionMechanical": "A hazard with this trait is a constructed physical object.",
    "TraitDescriptionMental": "A mental effect can alter the target's mind. It has no effect on an object or a mindless creature.",
    "TraitDescriptionMetal": "Effects with the metal trait either manipulate or conjure metal. Those that manipulate metal have no effect in an area without metal. Creatures with this trait consist primarily of metal or have a magical connection to that element.",
    "TraitDescriptionMetamagic": "Actions with the metamagic trait, usually from metamagic feats, tweak the properties of your spells. You must use a metamagic action directly before Casting the Spell you want to alter. If you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than Cast a Spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the metamagic action. Any additional effects added by a metamagic action are part of the spell's effect, not of the metamagic action itself.",
    "TraitDescriptionMindless": "A mindless creature has either programmed or rudimentary mental attributes. Most, if not all, of their mental attribute modifiers are -5. They are immune to all mental effects.",
    "TraitDescriptionMindshift": "An action with this trait can always be altered to use the raw power of your mind. When you take this action, you can choose to replace any damage it deals with mental damage, give it the mental trait, and replace any save it requires with a Will save. The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.",
    "TraitDescriptionMinion": "Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. A creature with this trait can use only 2 actions per turn, doesn't have reactions, and can't act when it's not your turn. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For an animal companion, you Command an Animal; for a minion that's a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain a Spell or Sustain an Activation; if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long enough, typically 1 minute, mindless minions usually don't act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act how they please. A minion can't control other creatures.",
    "TraitDescriptionMisfortune": "A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it. If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.",
    "TraitDescriptionMissive": "A missive is a piece of magical stationery that must be crafted and composed before it can be activated. All missives have the missive and consumable traits. Missives are often constructed of paper, parchment, or vellum, but any other thin, portable material that can hold writing or embossing upon it can be crafted into missives. After being crafted, the missive is a blank sheet until a message is composed upon it, completing its magic.",
    "TraitDescriptionModification": "A feat with this trait alters the construction of your innovation. If you have the reconfigure class feature, you can retrain such a feat more easily.",
    "TraitDescriptionModular": "The weapon has multiple configurations that you can switch between using an Interact action. Typically, switching between configurations of a modular weapon allows it to deal different types of damage (listed in the trait, such as \"modular B, P, or S\"), though it's possible for a modular weapon's description to list more complicated configurations.",
    "TraitDescriptionMonk": "Abilities with this trait are from the monk class. A weapon with this trait is primarily used by monks.",
    "TraitDescriptionMonkWeapon": "Many monks learn to use these weapons.",
    "TraitDescriptionMorph": "Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical. You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to counteract the first (in the same manner as two polymorph effects, described in that trait). Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.",
    "TraitDescriptionMounted": "Mounted siege weapons take up a certain size and space, and typically have statistics to allow them to be attacked. They're used for large-scale warfare.",
    "TraitDescriptionMove": "An action with this trait involves moving from one space to another.",
    "TraitDescriptionMulticlass": "Archetypes with the multiclass trait represent diversifying your training into another class's specialties. You can't select a multiclass archetype's dedication feat if you are a member of the class of the same name.",
    "TraitDescriptionMutagen": "An elixir with the mutagen trait temporarily transmogrifies the subject's body and alters its mind. A mutagen always conveys one or more beneficial effects paired with one or more detrimental effects. Mutagens are polymorph effects, meaning you can benefit from only one at a time.",
    "TraitDescriptionNagaji": "A traditionalist ancestry with reptilian features and serpentine heads.",
    "TraitDescriptionNecromancy": "Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the necromancy school of magic, typically involving forces of life and death.",
    "TraitDescriptionNegative": "Effects with this trait heal undead creatures with negative energy, deal negative damage to living creatures, or manipulate negative energy.",
    "TraitDescriptionNoisy": "This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence when you're using the Avoid Notice exploration activity. The armor's check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you meet the required Strength score.",
    "TraitDescriptionNone": "This trait has no description.",
    "TraitDescriptionNonlethal": "Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal, and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a -2 circumstance penalty.",
    "TraitDescriptionOath": "Oaths add an additional tenet to your code. You can usually have only one feat with this trait.",
    "TraitDescriptionOccult": "This magic comes from the occult tradition, calling upon bizarre and ephemeral mysteries. Anything with this trait is magical.",
    "TraitDescriptionOil": "Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that are typically applied to an object and are used up in the process.",
    "TraitDescriptionOlfactory": "An olfactory effect can affect only creatures that can smell it. This applies only to olfactory parts of the effect, as determined by the GM.",

    "TraitDescriptionOracle": "This indicates abilities from the oracle class.",
    "TraitDescriptionOrc": "A creature with this trait is a member of the orc ancestry. A weapon with this trait is a weapon which orcs craft and use.",
    "TraitDescriptionOread": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Earth.",
    "TraitDescriptionOverflow": "Powerful impulses temporarily overdraw the energy of your kinetic gate. When you use an impulse that has the overflow trait, your kinetic aura deactivates until you revitalize it (typically with Channel Elements). Extinguishing your element this severely is taxing, and consequently, you can use only one overflow impulse per round, even if you reactivate your kinetic gate.",
    "TraitDescriptionParry": "This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend a single action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.",
    "TraitDescriptionPeachwood": "Peachwood weapons have a particularly auburn tinge to them when under direct sunlight. Peachwood is treated as darkwood for any undead creatures' resistances or weaknesses related to darkwood (allowing a peachwood weapon to bypass a jiang-shi's resistance, for example). In addition, peachwood weapons bypass a small portion of the resistances of any undead creature. Strikes with a peachwood weapon treat an undead's resistances against physical damage as 2 lower for standard-grade peachwood, and 4 lower for high-grade.",
    "TraitDescriptionPlant": "Vegetable creatures have the plant trait. They are distinct from normal plants. Magical effects with this trait manipulate or conjure plants or plant matter in some way. Those that manipulate plants have no effect in an area with no plants.",
    "TraitDescriptionPoison": "An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison damage. An item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction.",
    "TraitDescriptionPolymorph": "These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can't be under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical. Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don't allow the target to take on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry. If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items.",
    "TraitDescriptionPonderous": "The armor has moving parts or other complications that lengthen the wearer's initial reaction time. While wearing the armor, you take a –1 penalty to initiative checks. If you don't meet the armor's required Strength score, this penalty increases to be equal to the armor's check penalty if it's worse.",
    "TraitDescriptionPoppet": "A creature with this trait is a member of the poppet ancestry.",
    "TraitDescriptionPortable": "Portable siege weapons, such as battering rams, can be more easily carried and have a role in both warfare and smaller conflicts or exploration.",
    "TraitDescriptionPositive": "Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.",
    "TraitDescriptionPossession": "Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can't use a possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor's true body is unconscious (and can't wake up normally), unless the possession effect allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of the target's active spells and abilities that affect their body. A possessor can use any of the target's abilities that are purely physical, and it can't use any of its own abilities except spells and purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target's attack modifier, AC, Fortitude save, Reflex save, Perception, and physical skills, and its own Will save, mental skills, spell attack roll, and spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the possessor's invested items apply when using its own values, and the target's invested items apply when using the target's values). A possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only the caster, since it isn't in its own body. The possessor must use its own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0 Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first, the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is stunned for 1 minute.",
    "TraitDescriptionPotion": "A potion is a magical liquid activated when you drink it.",
    "TraitDescriptionPrecious": "Valuable materials with special properties have the precious trait. They can be substituted for base materials when you Craft items.",
    "TraitDescriptionPrediction": "Effects with this trait determine what is likely to happen in the near future. Most predictions are divinations.",
    "TraitDescriptionPress": "Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently affected by a multiple attack penalty. You can't use a press action when it's not your turn, even if you use the Ready activity. Some actions with the press trait also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a failure don't apply on a critical failure. If your press action succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For example, you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to resistance.)",
    "TraitDescriptionPrimal": "This magic comes from the primal tradition, connecting to the natural world and instinct. Anything with this trait is magical.",
    "TraitDescriptionProcessed": "An alchemical consumable with the processed trait can be created with Quick Alchemy but is too complex to create in a single action.",
    "TraitDescriptionPropulsive": "You add half your Strength modifier (if positive) to damage rolls with a propulsive ranged weapon. If you have a negative Strength modifier, you add your full Strength modifier instead.",

    "TraitDescriptionRage": "You must be raging to use abilities with the rage trait, and they end automatically when you stop raging.",
    "TraitDescriptionRange": "These attacks will either list a finite range or a range increment, which follows the normal rules for range increments.",
    "TraitDescriptionRangedTrip": "This weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill at a distance up to the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a -2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. As with using a melee weapon to trip, a ranged trip doesn't deal any damage when used to Trip.",
    "TraitDescriptionRanger": "This indicates abilities from the ranger class.",
    "TraitDescriptionRare": "This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world. A rare feat, spell, item or the like is available to players only if the GM decides to include it in the game, typically through discovery during play. Creatures with this trait are rare. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creatures is increased by 5.",
    "TraitDescriptionRatfolk": "A creature with this trait is a member of the ratfolk ancestry.",
    "TraitDescriptionRazing": "Razing weapons are particularly good at damaging objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal damage to an object (including shields and animated objects), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the object takes an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice.",
    "TraitDescriptionReach": "Natural attacks with this trait can be used to attack creatures up to the listed distance away instead of only adjacent creatures. Weapons with this trait are long and can be used to attack creatures up to 10 feet away instead of only adjacent creatures. For creatures that already have reach with the limb or limbs that wield the weapon, the weapon increases their reach by 5 feet.",
    "TraitDescriptionReckless": "Actions with the reckless trait run the risk of the pilot losing control of a vehicle. When performing a reckless action, the pilot must first attempt an appropriate piloting check to keep control of the vehicle.",
    "TraitDescriptionRecovery": "Recovery weapons are thrown weapons designed to return to the thrower when they miss the target. When you make an unsuccessful thrown Strike with this weapon, it flies back to your hand after the Strike is complete, allowing you to try again. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.",
    "TraitDescriptionReflection": "A creature with this trait has the reflection versatile heritage. Reflections are beings who are copies of living people, whether through cloning, planar duplication, or another mechanism. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by reflections.",
    "TraitDescriptionRelic": "An item with the relic trait grows in power with its wielder.",
    "TraitDescriptionReload": "While all weapons need some amount of time to get into position, many ranged weapons also need to be loaded and reloaded. This entry indicates how many Interact actions it takes to reload such weapons. This can be 0 if drawing ammunition and firing the weapon are part of the same action. If an item takes 2 or more actions to reload, the GM determines whether they must be performed together as an activity, or you can spend some of those actions during one turn and the rest during your next turn.",
    "TraitDescriptionRepeating": "A repeating weapon is typically a type of crossbow that has a shorter reload time. These weapons can't be loaded with individual bolts like other crossbows; instead, they require a magazine of specialized ammunition to be loaded into a special slot. Once that magazine is in place, the ammunition is automatically loaded each time the weapon is cocked to fire, reducing its reload to the value in its reload entry (typically 0). When the ammunition runs out, a new magazine must be loaded, which requires a free hand and 3 Interact actions (to remove the old magazine, retrieve the new magazine, and slot the new magazine in place). These actions don't need to be consecutive.",
    "TraitDescriptionResonant": "This weapon can channel energy damage. You gain the Conduct Energy free action while wielding a resonant weapon.",
    "TraitDescriptionRevelation": "Effects with this trait see things as they truly are.",
    "TraitDescriptionRogue": "This indicates abilities from the rogue class.",
    "TraitDescriptionSaggorak": "Ancient dwarven blacksmiths in Saggorak designed a series of spectacularly powerful runes. Only someone with legendary proficiency in Crafting, or a well-versed dwarven crafter from the city of Kovlar, can apply, transfer, or remove a rune with the Saggorak trait. Because of their considerable power, all Saggorak runes take up two property rune slots, and consequently they can be applied only to armor and weapons with at least a +2 potency rune.",
    "TraitDescriptionScatter": "This weapon fires a cluster of pellets in a wide spray. Scatter always has an area listed with it, indicating the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary target of attacks with a scatter weapon take the listed damage, and the target and all other creatures within the listed radius around it take 1 point of splash damage per weapon damage die.",
    "TraitDescriptionScroll": "A scroll contains a single spell you can cast without a spell slot.",
    "TraitDescriptionScrying": "A scrying effect lets you see, hear, or otherwise get sensory information from a distance using a sensor or apparatus, rather than your own eyes and ears.",
    "TraitDescriptionSecret": "The GM rolls the check for this ability in secret.",
    "TraitDescriptionShadow": "This magic involves shadows or the energy of the Shadow Plane.",
    "TraitDescriptionShieldThrow": "A shield with this trait is designed to be thrown as a ranged attack.",
    "TraitDescriptionShisk": "Secretive humanoids covered in bony plumage that reside underground.",
    "TraitDescriptionShoony": "A creature with this trait is a member of the shoony ancestry.",
    "TraitDescriptionShove": "You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
    "TraitDescriptionSkeleton": "This undead is made by animating a dead creature's skeleton with negative energy. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by skeletons.",
    "TraitDescriptionSkill": "A general feat with the skill trait improves your skills and their actions or gives you new actions for a skill. A feat with this trait can be selected when a class grants a skill feat or general feat. Archetype feats with the skill trait can be selected in place of a skill feat if you have that archetype's dedication feat.",
    "TraitDescriptionSleep": "This effect can cause a creature to fall asleep or get drowsy.",
    "TraitDescriptionSnare": "Traps typically made by rangers, snares follow special rules that allow them to be constructed quickly and used on the battlefield.",
    "TraitDescriptionSocial": "Actions and abilities with the social trait can be used only while a vigilante is in their social identity.",
    "TraitDescriptionSonic": "An effect with the sonic trait functions only if it makes sound, meaning it has no effect in an area of silence or in a vacuum. This is different from an auditory spell, which is effective only if the target can hear it. A sonic effect might deal sonic damage.",
    "TraitDescriptionSorcerer": "This indicates abilities from the sorcerer class.",
    "TraitDescriptionSpellgun": "The spellgun trait appears on items that can generate a magical effect that flies out like a bullet. You can make either a spell attack roll with a spellgun or a ranged attack roll using your proficiency with simple firearms. Spellguns have a range increment, which applies regardless of which type of attack roll you make. Though you can use your modifier for simple firearms, a spellgun isn't actually a firearm. You don't get the damage of a firearm Strike, nor other benefits like critical specialization. Similarly, you can't load or reload a spellgun, affix talismans to one, make a spellgun Strike as part of an action that lets you make a firearm Strike, and so on.",
    "TraitDescriptionSpellheart": "Spellhearts are permanent items that work similarly to talismans. You affix a spellheart using the Affix a Spellheart activity, which is otherwise identical to Affix a Talisman. The limit of one talisman per item remains—an item can have one spellheart or one talisman, not both. When casting a cantrip from a spellheart, you can use your own spell attack roll or spell DC if it's higher. Crafting a spellheart requires the spells the spellheart can cast. For example, a major five-feather wreath requires air walk, gale blast, and wall of wind.",
    "TraitDescriptionSplash": "When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target's weaknesses or resistances. You don't multiply splash damage on a critical hit.",
    "TraitDescriptionSplash10": "When you use a thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don't add your Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 10 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target's weaknesses or resistances. You don't multiply splash damage on a critical hit.",
    "TraitDescriptionSpirit": "Effects with this trait can affect creatures with spiritual essence and might deal spirit damage. A creature with this trait is defined by its spiritual essence. Spirit creatures often lack a material form.",
    "TraitDescriptionSprite": "A family of diminutive winged fey with a strong connection to primal magic.",
    "TraitDescriptionStaff": "This magic item holds spells of a particular theme and allows a spellcaster to cast additional spells by preparing the staff.",
    "TraitDescriptionStance": "A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you use an action with the stance trait, you can't use another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.",
    "TraitDescriptionSteam": "Items with this trait are powered by engines that boil water to produce steam and move their components.",
    "TraitDescriptionStrix": "Winged humanoids, most of whom live in and around Cheliax.",
    "TraitDescriptionStructure": "An item with the structure trait creates a magical building or other structure when activated. The item must be activated on a plot of land free of other structures. The structure adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but it can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If activated on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the structure's foundation (if any) reaches the solid ground. If an item with this trait is activated on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a @Check[type:flat|dc:3] each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink or collapse. The structure doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the structure when the item is activated ends up unharmed inside the complete structure and always has a clear path of escape. A creature inside the structure when the activation ends isn't harmed, and it lands harmlessly on the ground if it was on an upper level of the structure.",
    "TraitDescriptionSubjectiveGravity": "On planes with this trait, all bodies of mass can be centers of gravity with the same amount of force, but only if a non-mindless creature wills it.",
    "TraitDescriptionSuli": "Sulis are planar scions descended from jann.",
    "TraitDescriptionSummoned": "A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can't summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to Cast a Spell of equal or higher level than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands. Immediately when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends.",
    "TraitDescriptionSummoner": "This indicates abilities from the Summoner class.",
    "TraitDescriptionSwashbuckler": "This indicates abilities from the Swashbuckler class.",
    "TraitDescriptionSweep": "This weapon makes wide sweeping or spinning attacks, making it easier to attack multiple enemies. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.",
    "TraitDescriptionSylph": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Air.",
    "TraitDescriptionTalisman": "A talisman is a small object affixed to armor, a shield, or a weapon (called the affixed item). You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a talisman attached to it. Once activated, a talisman burns out permanently.",
    "TraitDescriptionTalos": "Taloses are planar scions descended from zuhras.",
    "TraitDescriptionTandem": "Actions with this trait involve you and your eidolon acting in concert. You can't use a tandem action if either you or your eidolon can't act, if you haven't Manifested your Eidolon, or if you've Manifested your Eidolon in a way where it isn't a separate entity (such as with the Meld into Eidolon feat). Tandem actions often let both you and your eidolon take separate actions, but these must be actions taken separately by you and your eidolon; you can't use a tandem action to take another tandem action.",
    "TraitDescriptionTattoo": "A tattoo is a type of item that is drawn or cut into a creature's skin and usually takes the form of images or symbols.",
    "TraitDescriptionTech": "Items with this trait are associated with the technology of Numeria.",
    "TraitDescriptionTelepathy": "A creature with telepathy can communicate mentally with creatures. This doesn't give any special access to their thoughts, and communicates no more information than normal speech would.",
    "TraitDescriptionTeleportation": "Teleportation effects allow you to instantaneously move from one point in space to another. Teleportation does not usually trigger reactions based on movement.",
    "TraitDescriptionTengu": "A creature with this trait is a member of the tengu ancestry. Tengus are humanoids who resemble birds. An ability with this trait can be used or selected only by tengus. An item with this trait is created and used by tengus.",
    "TraitDescriptionTethered": "This weapon is attached to a length of rope or chain that allows you to retrieve it after it has left your hand. If you have a free hand while wielding this weapon, you can use an Interact action to pull the weapon back into your grasp after you have thrown it as a ranged attack or after it has been disarmed (unless it is being held by another creature).",
    "TraitDescriptionThaumaturge": "This indicates abilities from the thaumaturge class.",
    "TraitDescriptionThrown": "You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment.",
    "TraitDescriptionTiefling": "A creature with this trait is a member of the tiefling ancestry.",
    "TraitDescriptionTraining": "A training weapon is designed to be used when training an animal to participate in combat by identifying the target for the animal to attack. Striking a creature with a training weapon gives your animal companion or your bonded animal a +1 circumstance bonus to its next attack roll against that target.",
    "TraitDescriptionTransmutation": "Effects and magic items with this trait are associated with the transmutation school of magic, typically changing something's form.",
    "TraitDescriptionTrap": "A hazard or item with this trait is constructed to hinder interlopers.",
    "TraitDescriptionTrip": "You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.",
    "TraitDescriptionTrueName": "Certain spells, feats, and items have the true name trait. This trait means they require you to know a creature's true name to use them.",
    "TraitDescriptionTwin": "These weapons are used as a pair, complementing each other. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon's number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type to benefit from this trait, but they don't need to have the same runes.",
    "TraitDescriptionTwoHand": "This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice, such as those from striking runes.",
    "TraitDescriptionUnarmed": "An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn't a weapon, though it's categorized with weapons for weapon groups, and it might have weapon traits. Since it's part of your body, an unarmed attack can't be Disarmed. It also doesn't take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage follows the same rules as a free-hand weapon.",
    "TraitDescriptionUncommon": "Something of uncommon rarity requires special training or comes from a particular culture or part of the world. Some character choices give access to uncommon options, and the GM can choose to allow access for anyone. Less is known about uncommon creatures than common creatures. They typically can't be summoned. The DC of Recall Knowledge checks related to these creature is increased by 2.",
    "TraitDescriptionUndine": "A type of geniekin descended from a being from the Plane of Water.",

    "TraitDescriptionVanara": "An inquisitive ancestry with primate-like features and prehensile tails.",
    "TraitDescriptionVehicular": "A vehicular weapon is attached to a vehicle or worn by a mount and can typically only be wielded by the driver of the vehicle or the mount's primary rider.

    "TraitDescriptionVersatile": "A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than that listed in the Damage entry. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon that is versatile S can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you make an attack.",
    "TraitDescriptionVirulent": "Afflictions with the virulent trait are harder to remove. You must succeed at two consecutive saves to reduce a virulent affliction's stage by 1. A critical success reduces a virulent affliction's stage by only 1 instead of by 2.",
