Though such forewarning potentially gives distant creatures additional time to prepare to face or escape the creature, Desert's Howl enjoys the steady build-up of fear that this approach allows, potentially breaking its victims' resolve long before it even appears. Besides, a creature of its power has little to fear from travelers, or even most adventurers, regardless of how much time they have to prepare.

Instead, he's one of a rare type of fey native to the First World who enjoy causing bloody mayhem in the Material Plane. These fey are so rare and so distrustful of one another's company that two have never been seen together; the mistaken assumption that only a single Spring-Heeled Jack exists is therefore entirely understandable. The fact that sightings occur across Ustalav (and beyond) and across centuries of time is ascribed to the trickster's long lifespan and mysterious ability to travel quickly, or to the belief that there's no such creature, merely an urban legend that twisted minds attempt to bring to life through costumes, magic, and a series of murders and mayhem. Even in fear-drenched Ustalav, no one has yet guessed that multiple Spring-Heeled Jacks exist or postulated that some future event might drive them to overcome their mutual disdain and gather into a murderous cabal, far more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks are cruel-eyed, hairy fey with vaguely humanoid shapes and extra features that cause them to be easily mistaken for demons or devils. Glowing eyes, cloven hooves, menacing horns, and a pointed tail combine to create the mien of a wicked imp; his love of sudden and sadistic violence completes the impression. Almost all have jet-black skin and fur, though a few exceptions might exist.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks typically hide their features in tattered cloaks, appearing as a hunched elder or a youth in the nighttime conditions they enjoy. Such a disguise rarely holds up to any scrutiny, but that doesn't matter much to the Spring-Heeled Jack, who only needs something that offers just enough doubt for their target to move within striking distance, which can be from much farther away than most other creatures even realize. Once close enough, the Spring-Heeled Jack leaps startling distances in the blink of an eye to easily slash at a victim who had, until that moment, considered themself safe.</p>",

Their terrifying spores also mean that most survivors of their attacks tend to be disoriented and delirious, relating accounts of the monster that are distorted by confusion and fear. This, along with the natural variance between different Melfesh Monsters, means that even the most diligent of researchers will come across contradictory evidence. Even if they learn from all the prior information collected over the years, they're still often caught off guard when trying to hunt down and fell the threat since the new Melfesh Monster might have an ability never seen before.

These linnorms are roughly the equivalent of older teenagers when compared to other species. Younger linnorms, while still primal creatures with a strong tie to the First World, haven't yet manifested most of their magical powers. They still can't breathe deadly fire or lightning or see invisible creatures, and, most importantly, they can be slain without prompting the linnorm's legendary death curse. They do, however, have voracious appetites, consuming any living thing to fuel their rapid growth. A linnorm is most vulnerable during this time; scouts who find tracks of a young linnorm quickly muster a hunting party of stalwart and experienced warriors to track the creature down and kill it quickly-before they draw the attention of the linnorm's father.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Krampus is a tall, goatlike humanoid with a pointed nose, swept-back horns, and hooved feet. His long, greasy tongue continually flickers out from his mouth, occasionally licking droplets of spittle from his dark brown fur. He wields a set of iron chains that act as an extension of his will. Krampus is never seen without a wicker basket draped over one shoulder, its bottom often stained with the blood of his victims. Krampus stands a little over 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Krampus's origin is unknown; residents of the small towns and villages he terrorizes in northern Irrisen believe the creature has always existed, coming forth once a year to punish those he deems wicked. While many legends have been told about Krampus's beginning, the most popular of them starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After a series of harsh winters that the townsfolk barely survived, they began to doubt the power of the druids and their rituals. As the villagers grew more resentful, the druid circle took drastic action. Under the light of a blue moon, the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and called forth the most powerful spiritual essence they could, and a new creature was born-Krampus. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' bitter resentment and doubt. Instead of a central figure to lead them in winter celebrations, as they had hoped, the druids had spawned a monster who sought to punish those who had behaved selfishly during lean times.</p>\n<p>Recognizing their error, the druids sought to banish their creation. They tracked Krampus down as he slept and shackled him in cold iron chains, hoping to subdue him and force him back to the First World. But Krampus was no fey, and cold iron held no power over him. When he awoke, he ripped the chains free, claimed them as his own, and tracked down the druids who had dared try to capture him. After their betrayal, Krampus can see no good in any mortal and longs only to punish the wicked for their selfish misdeeds.</p>\n<p>To this day, Krampus takes vicious delight in transforming his victims into the petulant children before killing them, and no manner of sacrifice can appease him. Luckily for any nearby villages, Krampus stalks their streets but once a year.</p>\n<p>Locals believe that Krampus makes his lair among the deep crevasses of ice somewhere within the Winterwall Glacier, which lines Avistan's northernmost reaches. No adventurer has yet braved the treacherous expanse to find and defeat him.</p>\n<p>While Krampus is most infamous for tracking and punishing the naughty, his own sins often inform his vindictive responses to others' misdeeds. An incarnation of Krampus who arose from irrepressible greed might possess abilities that better reflect his fierce miserly behavior, emphasizing less the abduction of miscreants and more the disproportionate punishment of thieves and robbers. Such a variant Krampus might arise in different cultures that tell different stories about Krampus, or Krampus's powers and nature might drift between incarnations each time he is defeated and arises anew elsewhere in the world the following year. In these cultures or incarnations, Krampus represents a remorseless yet generous spirit who's willing to grant boons to the truly worthy while tormenting any who fail his morality tests.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for people in regions terrorized by this Krampus, his definition of \"any who fail his morality tests\" tend to be nearly everyone but the most innocent and generous of people.</p>",

Though quite similar to the descriptions of Desert's Howl, they seem to be individuals who haven't yet fully completed their transformation into the terrifying beast. Whether these unfortunate people met a cruel fate similar to that which spawned Desert's Howl or are spawn of the nightmarish creature itself is unclear. Some reports of encounters with these creatures note that it's possible to revert the creature back to its humanoid form by cleansing its mind of nightmarish visions, though there's no solid evidence of such an event ever occurring.</p>",
