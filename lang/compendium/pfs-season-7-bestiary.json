They constantly use these magical energies to empower their magical abilities and even their bodies, as the energy can heal wounds. A fortune dragon has a typical build for an arcane dragon, but their bodies sport a striking feature: their treasure. The dragon's nature of drawing upon magic causes coins, gems, and, most notably, magical items to cling to their body like iron drawn to magnets. A dragon constantly pulls magical energies from the items attached to their body and makes use of these energies to cast spells. The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process. Fortune dragons are seekers of novel experiences. This desire for originality leads fortune dragons to approach visitors of other ancestries with curiosity, though this initial interest quickly wanes if a visitor lacks exciting qualities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic.

Scholars debate the classification of these dragons, with some preferring the name magical dragons and others using traditional dragons due to their connection to specific magical traditions.

While some goblins are civilized and have worked hard to be considered upstanding members of humanoid communities, many are impetuous and vicious creatures who delight in wreaking havoc. These goblins think nothing of slaughtering livestock, stealing, or burning down a building purely for momentary delight. They revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call \"longshanks.\"</p>\n<p>Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with fire; goblins who master magic or fire earn great respect from their kin. Most other humanoids find it difficult to understand goblins' outlook: they hate canines but eagerly share their lairs with so-called \"goblin dogs,\" they fearlessly attack larger creatures but are terrified of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices.</p>",
