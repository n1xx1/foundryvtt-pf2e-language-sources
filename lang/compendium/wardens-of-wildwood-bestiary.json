Their outgoing charm isn't just for their own entertainment; by engaging with flora and fauna alike, they coax local organisms to interact with each other, whether that's teaching animals how to forage together or introducing vines to new surfaces they can climb. This extends even to travelers and foresters. After all, a lumberjack offered salutations is less likely to scuffle with wildlife and knows someone's watching to ensure they don't overharvest a forest's bounty.</p>\n<p>Azhanas perform some of this gardening themselves. They carry hefty shears, clipping back invasive species and trimming branches to afford new sprouts a taste of sunlight. Likewise, they occasionally visit rural settlements, offering to teach wilderness skills that help civilization and nature coexist peacefully. Those who respond kindly earn an azhana's generosity. Those who threaten nature or fey instead earn the azhana's ire, usually involving magical misfortunes as small animals steal food, tools melt into useless shapes, and roots suddenly shift to send a trespasser tumbling down a ravine.</p>\n<p>Azhanas sometimes gather into small groups called sisterhoods, even if they include rare, non-female azhanas. These groups provide camaraderie and aid in resolving difficult obstacles. Less often, they form organically when an azhana adopts and mentors newborn azhanas. These creatures are never children; instead, they emerge fully formed from mature trees, accompanied by nearby trees thrumming softly in a celebratory chorus. Though any mature tree might suffice, most often an azhana's parent tree stands in some place of primal power or divine significance, such as where a nature deity performed a miracle.</p>\n<h2>Arboreal Friends</h2>\n<p>Azhanas are friends and tenders to the massive arboreals, and are found in the same locations—wooded stands of trees in places of primal power. These two beings don't necessarily live among each other continually, but many azhanas count at least a couple of arboreals among their friend group and visit the living trees to share stories, groom them, or engage in friendly games.</p>",

Once so ensconced, the cythnophorian seeks out new victims to infect with its noxious spores, seizing control of their bodies for its own ends until they succumb to the deadly toxin and become incubators for new cythnophorians.</p>\n<p>A Medium-sized corpse is typically sufficient to sustain a cythnophorian for two weeks before it must seek out a fresh one.

Sometimes called a \"batterfrill\" by members of the Rootweft Lodge, durnoliths are stocky quadrupedal powerhouses encased in dense wooden plates. While they may look slow and lumbering, their wide-set, muscular legs bear their weight with ease. Durnoliths have a hard bone and wood frill framing their head, which they use both offensively and defensively. Easily angered, durnoliths are prone to charging headlong into a fight, battering and smashing their prey senseless with their armored frill, then clawing their prey to ribbons with their razor-sharp claws.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Woodwarps are mutated monsters created when a sapient creature is flooded with unchecked energy from the Plane of Wood that they're unable to control. This rush of all-consuming planar energy scours the creature from the inside out, subsequently warping them into a monstrous humanoid-plant hybrid—an aberration possessing the physiological features of both, painfully reshaped into something dreadful to behold.</p>\n<p>A woodwarp's form and features are determined by the size of the creature they were before their transformation—thrailorns were Small, and durnoliths were Medium. Regardless of their appearance and form, woodwarps endure constant pain from the dense root network that grows inside of them, piercing bone, muscle, and internal organs. This agonizing, all-consuming pain drives woodwarps to violence, causing them to lash out at everything around them.</p>\n<p>In her quest for ultimate power, Ruzadoya Quickmane devised a ritual to purposefully funnel energy from the Plane of Wood into her followers, transforming them into either a woodwarped monstrosity or an elite woodblessed soldier known as Ruzadoya's Chosen. An elaborate wooden ritual focus carved from Idyllis, a tree from the Plane of Wood, serves as the focus for this ritual and the source of planar energy. During a woodwarp's transformation, this wooden ritual focus fuses to the body and becomes the origin point for the woodwarp's root network. Woodwarps created through such rituals are easier to control than woodwarps created by happenstance, as an experienced ritualist can imprint their will upon a woodwarp during their transformation. Such woodwarps serve Ruzadoya as hunters, sentries, and vicious shock troops.</p>\n<h2>Just A Name</h2>\n<p>While woodwarps have proper names, it's unlikely that members of the Rootweft Lodge will discover them. Instead, the woodwarps are referred to by monikers or nicknames. Thrailorns are dubbed \"thornbacks\" and durnoliths are dubbed \"batterfrills.\"</p>\n<h2>Other Woodwarps</h2>\n<p>Thrailorns and durnoliths are not the only types of woodwarps. Creatures of different sizes result in different woodwarps. Sprites, fey dragonets, jinkins, and other Tiny creatures become izifaines—headless woodwarps with fleshy wings and a sharp stinger shrouded in toxic flower petals. Centaurs, minotaurs, giants, and other Large creatures become rogoars—athletic woodwarps with muscular, elongated arms who wrestle their prey.</p>",

Instead, he's one of a rare type of fey native to the First World who enjoy causing bloody mayhem in the Material Plane. These fey are so rare and so distrustful of one another's company that two have never been seen together; the mistaken assumption that only a single Spring-Heeled Jack exists is therefore entirely understandable. The fact that sightings occur across Ustalav (and beyond) and across centuries of time is ascribed to the trickster's long lifespan and mysterious ability to travel quickly, or to the belief that there's no such creature, merely an urban legend that twisted minds attempt to bring to life through costumes, magic, and a series of murders and mayhem. Even in fear-drenched Ustalav, no one has yet guessed that multiple Spring-Heeled Jacks exist or postulated that some future event might drive them to overcome their mutual disdain and gather into a murderous cabal, far more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks are cruel-eyed, hairy fey with vaguely humanoid shapes and extra features that cause them to be easily mistaken for demons or devils. Glowing eyes, cloven hooves, menacing horns, and a pointed tail combine to create the mien of a wicked imp; his love of sudden and sadistic violence completes the impression. Almost all have jet-black skin and fur, though a few exceptions might exist.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks typically hide their features in tattered cloaks, appearing as a hunched elder or a youth in the nighttime conditions they enjoy. Such a disguise rarely holds up to any scrutiny, but that doesn't matter much to the Spring-Heeled Jack, who only needs something that offers just enough doubt for their target to move within striking distance, which can be from much farther away than most other creatures even realize. Once close enough, the Spring-Heeled Jack leaps startling distances in the blink of an eye to easily slash at a victim who had, until that moment, considered themself safe.</p>",

Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are usually as strong as they are vicious. The worst ogres are sadists, enjoying remorseless murder, torture, and violence in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on other humanoids—the smaller the better—ogre captivity can end in a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp: becoming dinner. But for all their creativity in inflicting pain, ogres often forget that their playthings lack their own robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, and many of their captives die sooner than the ogres might prefer. Meanwhile, those who manage to survive captivity in an ogre's larder often emerge with lasting mental scars. A captive able to keep their wits about them, however, can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, more plentiful food sources, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's often-limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape or gain revenge.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"—usually the family's patriarch or matriarch—whom the other ogres in the family learn to quickly obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin.

Trolls are truly creatures of the forest, deeply linked in flesh and blood to the verdant habitats they consider their territory.

      "description": "<p>When a gnome, halfling, pixie, goblin, or other Small creature is transformed into a woodwarp, they become a thrailorn. Sometimes called a \"thornback\" by members of the Rootweft Lodge, thrailorns are nimble and strong with a muscular, compact body. Their torso is coiled in thorny branches and growths that sprout long, barbed thorns. These thorns cause deep puncture wounds and can become embedded in the flesh of any creature who gets too close. A thrailorn's head is obscured within their thorny hide, with only their slavering maw and needle-like teeth visible. Though they have poor vision, they have a keen sense of smell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Woodwarps are mutated monsters created when a sapient creature is flooded with unchecked energy from the Plane of Wood that they're unable to control. This rush of all-consuming planar energy scours the creature from the inside out, subsequently warping them into a monstrous humanoid-plant hybrid—an aberration possessing the physiological features of both, painfully reshaped into something dreadful to behold.</p>\n<p>A woodwarp's form and features are determined by the size of the creature they were before their transformation—thrailorns were Small, and durnoliths were Medium. Regardless of their appearance and form, woodwarps endure constant pain from the dense root network that grows inside of them, piercing bone, muscle, and internal organs. This agonizing, all-consuming pain drives woodwarps to violence, causing them to lash out at everything around them.</p>\n<p>In her quest for ultimate power, Ruzadoya Quickmane devised a ritual to purposefully funnel energy from the Plane of Wood into her followers, transforming them into either a woodwarped monstrosity or an elite woodblessed soldier known as Ruzadoya's Chosen. An elaborate wooden ritual focus carved from Idyllis, a tree from the Plane of Wood, serves as the focus for this ritual and the source of planar energy. During a woodwarp's transformation, this wooden ritual focus fuses to the body and becomes the origin point for the woodwarp's root network. Woodwarps created through such rituals are easier to control than woodwarps created by happenstance, as an experienced ritualist can imprint their will upon a woodwarp during their transformation. Such woodwarps serve Ruzadoya as hunters, sentries, and vicious shock troops.</p>\n<h2>Just A Name</h2>\n<p>While woodwarps have proper names, it's unlikely that members of the Rootweft Lodge will discover them. Instead, the woodwarps are referred to by monikers or nicknames. Thrailorns are dubbed \"thornbacks\" and durnoliths are dubbed \"batterfrills.\"</p>\n<h2>Other Woodwarps</h2>\n<p>Thrailorns and durnoliths are not the only types of woodwarps. Creatures of different sizes result in different woodwarps. Sprites, fey dragonets, jinkins, and other Tiny creatures become izifaines—headless woodwarps with fleshy wings and a sharp stinger shrouded in toxic flower petals. Centaurs, minotaurs, giants, and other Large creatures become rogoars—athletic woodwarps with muscular, elongated arms who wrestle their prey.</p>",
