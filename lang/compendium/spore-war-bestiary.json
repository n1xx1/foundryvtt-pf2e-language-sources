These inimical creatures are a form of primordial and alien evil that predates mortal life, and most immortal life as well. Since the rise of mortal sin and the associated expansion of demonic life through the Outer Rifts, qlippoth have been driven to their deepest reaches, and they seethe with rancor at the loss of their realms. Yet, rather than directly oppose demons, qlippoth instead turn to the source—mortal sin—and wage an endless war to eradicate all creatures capable of sinful acts so that the demonic tide might be turned back. To ensure they do not bolster their foe's ranks, they enact horrific transformations on their targets, converting their victims into beings incapable of discerning right from wrong; this renders them unable to be judged by Pharasma's courts and thus incapable of becoming fiends. Most mortals consider the ministrations of a qlippoth to be far worse than any fate awaiting them in the afterlife.</p>",

These succubi sought to slay a powerful witch who had befouled a profane temple the assassins served. The succubi failed at their mission, but from their corpses grew the first fungus tyrants. Pleased with this development, the witch then seeded numerous worlds on the Material Plane with fungus tyrant spores, who have since grown and thrived in their new environments as rot thrives in a corpse. Today, hundreds of fungus tyrants inhabit the fouler locales of the Material Plane. They're particularly fond of large cave systems and ruined cities, but also can be found in corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule or in the sewers of active cities that spew vast amounts of magical waste.</p>\n<p>An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting with methodical intent can be evidence of a fungus tyrant's manipulations, but fungus tyrants are equally fond of keeping other types of creatures as pets and thralls—particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the fungus tyrant's embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid ruler. Yet most fungus tyrants realize that a diverse array of guardians is best, and they often choose to keep some non-fungus minions on hand to protect their lair.</p>\n<p>Fungus tyrants are violently jealous. Any who attempt to lure away their dominated pets or cure those who have been infected by them earns their eternal ire. Yet it's succubi who enrage fungus tyrants the most. In these demons, the fungus tyrant sees a former glamour and power they no longer have access to, and only the brutal destruction of these mocking memories can salve a fungus tyrant's anger. A fungus tyrant faced with someone whom they suspect might be a succubus is terrible indeed, for in such battles, the fiendish fungal beings abandon their normal approach of subtle mental trickery and bring all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart. Fungus tyrants also take great delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control.</p>\n<p>While their jealousy doesn't compel them to do battle with other fungus tyrants, they're always careful to maintain their own territories apart from any nearby kin, and they take great pains not to \"poach\" other tyrant's charmed and infested pets.</p>\n<p>A fungus tyrant is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.</p><h2>Spore Thralls</h2><p>When a creature becomes a spore thrall, it rises from death with the same statistics it had in life, but gains the fungus trait, as well as immunity to death effects, disease, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.6uEgoh53GbXuHpTF]{Paralyzed}, and poison, and its alignment switches to match that of the fungus tyrant who created them. When a spore thrall is slain, its soul finally travels to the Boneyard for judgment, but the fungus-encrusted physical remains often spawn new fungal creatures, such as myceloids, violet fungi, or drakauthixes. These fungal spawn are not controlled by the fungus tyrant but generally regard them as an ally or, more often, a divinity.</p>",

Against those who threaten their realm, such as loggers eager to harvest lumber or settlers aiming to establish croplands or a town, arboreals' wrath is unwavering and devastating.

Unlike other demons, the dreaded vrolikai doesn't form directly from a single soul—they instead manifest when a demon devours so many damned souls that their own individual desires are lost in the sinful cacophony. A vrolikai who survives this process gains great power and can claim a region of the Outer Rifts as their own domain.</p>\n<p>Vrolikais' enthusiastic embrace of the multitude of sins makes them uniquely suited to lead and unite demons, such that even demon lords often must rely on vrolikais to command their forces. The chaotic and conflicting motivations of demonkind leave little room to find common ground, but the vrolikai can expound upon the beauty of every kind of sin while marching demon armies to battle.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Outer Rifts, it can become a deadly fiend—a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin—be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more \"specialized\" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold—the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin. In this way demons ensure a never-ending supply of new demons to bolster their ever-growing ranks in the Outer Rifts.</p>\n<p>Demons are selfish and self-absorbed creatures, and most firmly believe that mortals only play at being more virtuous than fiends. They enjoy tempting mortals into damnation to both indulge their egos and swell their armies. Like many other fiends, one of the great rewards of this manipulation is fulfilling their hunger for souls. In their eyes, the primary use for these souls is to spawn new demons, who can serve as soldiers, slaves, pawns, or even currency for their more powerful masters.</p>",
