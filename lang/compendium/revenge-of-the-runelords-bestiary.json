At the same time, the creatures feel as if something unimaginably powerful and hungry is chasing them... and gaining on them. Any PC who looks over their shoulder sees that the stars are indeed winking out behind them, as if an immense black object were growing closer or as if the stars themselves were vanishing.

Such detritus typically consist of dead adventurers and their gear; an eron won't hesitate to attack a living adventurer, though, and they make little distinction between living or dead \"clutter\" that doesn't belong.</p><h2>Remnant Hunters</h2><p>When an eron of Jandelay finds itself on a doomed world, they often seek out an eclectic list of items, remains, and sometimes even creatures from that planet, almost as if they were picking and choosing their favorite parts of that world before it is no more. Whether the planet is literally on its last days makes no difference to the visiting eron. To these ageless monitors, the actual timing of a world's end is irrelevant to their hunt. Sometimes, valuable scavenged treasures can be discovered amid larger objects or vehicles an eron has been carrying with it via <em>telekinetic haul</em>.</p>",

Few trolls have heard the laughter of demons who claim that creator cursed the trolls and cast them down from lofty heights, binding them so they could never rise again.</p>\n<p>Trolls prefer to remain solitary, keeping every scrap of food for themselves. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead groups of trolls. Such warleaders possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem.

These qualities allow it to adapt rapidly to different environments, some of them quite extreme, and also makes it susceptible to magical radiation and experimentation. Many a Darklands apprentice takes their first steps in the school of transmutation by practicing on these worms, while variations-both natural and cultivated-are scattered about beneath Golarion's surface.</p>",

A risen runelord ordered to undertake obviously self-destructive actions might, at the GM's discretion, resist the command and could potentially even break free of their creator's control.</p>\n<p>Since raise runelord draws upon a runelord's legacy as it exists within the Dreamlands, no risen runelord can ever sleep or dream. Xanderghul can use a risen runelord in a special way: he can use any risen runelord (including ones he didn't create) as a spare body. If he's slain, his soul can instantly jump to the closest risen runelord to replace them and continue the fight, unless the PCs can disable this defense during the second adventure in Revenge of the Runelords. Regardless of level, all risen runelords are mythic creatures and are immune to sleep effects.</p><h2>Lust and Pride</h2><p>Of the seven sins, lust and pride are unique among the runelords for these sins were only ever represented by a single runelord—and both still live during the events of this Adventure Path. This may change once the events of Revenge of the Runelords come to a conclusion, in which case the sinful foci for lust and pride become potential options for risen runelords of Sorshen or Xanderghul, but during Revenge of the Runelords, no risen runelords of lust or pride can exist.</p><h2>Risen Runelord Gear</h2><p>A risen runelord's polearm is an extension of their being and cannot exist without them, vanishing upon their death.

These devotees fitted their empty eye sockets with emeralds magically imbued with the site plans for the Chambers, allowing them to patrol the extradimensional space in its entirety.

The few mortals to meet these enigmatic, faceless creatures have never known them to identify by any name other than the ancient ones, seemingly holding no identity (or no identity they wish to share) beyond their relationship with time.</p>\n<p>The ancients profess to have always existed in the Dimension of Time, and for time to have always existed in the Great Beyond. Most reside in Stethelos, the storied city at the center of time, though they're also found wandering the Void, crossing the strangest corners of the Maelstrom where it lies between other planes, and occasionally, venturing into dark corners of the Universe. They serve at the will of Tawil at'Umr, the All in One and the One in All, an avatar of Yog-Sothoth lurking deep within time as Stethelos's caretaker. Though the ancient ones resemble their master in stature and attire, and though none would describe Tawil at'Umr as anything other than ancient in origin, most scholars consider \"ancient one\" a classification of its own separate from that of Great Old One, and Tawil at'Umr is definitively counted among the Great Old Ones by all who know it.</p>\n<p>Where Yog-Sothoth is an embodiment of all space and time, an entity who concerns himself with guarding cosmic secrets, the ancient ones are philosophers and mystics seeking ever more enlightenment. They search, have searched, and will search across time indefinitely and, having found entropy and disorder, conclude this to be the Great Beyond's ultimate purpose. When a new creature dawns, it's pristine and whole—perfectly ordered—for but a single moment before it can be eroded by Pharasma's poison, accumulating decay, change, and chaos, until finally it reaches its ending, when time leaves a twilight creature broken and gone. Law and chaos, the ancient ones believe, aren't opposing or even separate forces, but a single expression of reality viewed from two angles, different from each other only in time.</p><h2>How Old is Time?</h2><p>Lying in parallel with the Great Beyond with a presence felt on nearly every plane, from the Inner Sphere to the Outer Rifts, the Dimension of Time holds too many secrets for a reality so seemingly omnipresent.

    "Watcher": {
      "description": "<p>Watchers lurk in the shadows of the Universe, witnessing as history unfolds around them across space and time. They come to worlds on the brink of destruction, recording these worlds' fates and cataloguing apocalyptic events for eternal enshrinement in their massive archives of Jandelay. Watchers usually perform this work unseen, slipping into the background of a plane so they can set their strange beacons undisturbed and secretly place creatures into stasis for transport back to their archives.</p>\n<p>Though they concern themselves with calamities and apocalyptic events, the watchers have no desire to see a world end before its time. They're attracted to the actions of mortal heroes who defy fate and work to avert disasters, and they only rarely intervene to preserve an appointed apocalypse from being stalled by these heroes, often content to witness and record the curious heroics.</p>\n<p>When faced with unusual news or threats to Jandelay, watchers congregate into small councils to discuss and consider. These councils typically number no more than five watchers, with one watcher designated as the council's observer, recording and remembering the meetings. Watcher councils are patient and deliberate, slow to reach any decisions, but once they reach a conclusion, there's always a unanimous consensus.</p>\n<p>Watchers have six long, slick insectile legs and stand approximately 30 feet tall. Small, prehensile filaments hide within their talons, which allow the watchers to achieve an astonishing degree of manual precision.</p>\n<p>Many watchers hold an almost religious reverence for the cycle of preservation and destruction that emerges between themselves and the Oliphaunt of Jandelay. This dualistic belief in that which is eternal and that which is lost is commonly interpreted as a faith that deifies both the Oliphaunt and a mysterious First Watcher as demigods of Jandelay. The watchers are often seen alongside the Oliphaunt when it rampages across the Universe, and whether they truly see it as a god, a colleague, or merely a necessary planar phenomenon, the truth of their relationship might simply defy mortal categorization and understanding.</p><h2>Creation and Destruction</h2><p>The watchers share Jandelay's fields with the Oliphaunt, herald of the apocalypse, a gargantuan beast that visits worlds on the eve of their annihilation to wreak havoc and destruction. Few scholars can agree if the watchers reach a doomed world first, creating beacons that call the Oliphaunt, or if the Oliphaunt instinctively knows when a world is on the brink of calamity and the watchers follow it as their apocalyptic guide.</p><h2>Fending Off the Watchers</h2><p>The Beacons of Jandelay, towers of energy erected by watchers to mark worlds on the eve of their apocalypse, are a terrifying sight for those who recognize their significance. Though the watchers are commonly understood as mere observers and recorders, some scholars theorize the watchers call the Oliphaunt from Jandelay themselves only after erecting their beacons and preparing to record the ensuing calamity. By repelling the watchers and destroying their beacons (which have AC 48, Hardness 40, and 380 HP) or countering the beacons with an effect like dispel magic, these scholars believe doomed worlds can be snatched from the jaws of ruin.</p>",
