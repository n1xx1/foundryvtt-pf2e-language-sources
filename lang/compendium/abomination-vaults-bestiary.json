Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners.

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>These desert-based will-o'-wisps deal fire damage rather than electricity and delight in setting their victims aflame, relishing the resulting screams that echo across the landscape. They can quench their glow like other will-o'-wisps, but the nearer they remain to their burning victims, the more obvious their heat shimmer appears in the air.</p>",

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nearly always adherents of the grim deity Groetus, these will-o'-wisps resemble the leering skull-faced moon of their namesake.

When enemies come too close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim's strength being slowly devoured from within.</p>\n<p>Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords from all layers of Hell, rejoicing as they disseminate murder, misery, and anguish as they see fit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit fiends command entire infernal armies.</p>",

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>",

Even murder is merely another necessity, and they think nothing of creeping into a house, dispatching the residents, and taking what they want.</p>\n<p>Their chameleon-like ability to blend into their surroundings makes skulks difficult to detect, so their ever-present populations around the periphery of large settlements are nearly impossible to dislodge permanently. They typically travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared purpose for very long.</p>\n<p>Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around sewers and the like, are skulks' favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves' guild and become sought after for difficult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and overwhelming selfishness, however, usually means they are unable to secure longlasting leadership roles.</p>\n<p>A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human. Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for eradication to the exclusion of all other victims. More than one band of skulks has accidentally engineered its own doom after throwing caution to the wind and exposing its existence to the authorities in an ill-planned but violently passionate attempt to track down such an exile.</p>",

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Feeding not on fear but on the ephemeral potentiality of magic lodged in the minds of their victims, these will-o'-wisps are a bane to casters of all types.

It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws.

Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p>\n<p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p>\n<p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.</p>\n<p>Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o'-wisps haunt lonely marshes and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Aquatic will-o'-wisps, will-o'-the-deeps dwell within oceans and even terrestrial lakes, and strings of them can create profoundly beautiful vistas. Their propensity to draw ships toward reefs and whirlpools or to swarm smaller vessels makes them a deadly hazard.</p>",
