Though most azarketis live relatively peaceful lives of fishing or farming, they sometimes need to defend their homes against hostile forces, and some leave their communities to become adventurers.

Such sailors get to enjoy their time above deck while also having near-constant access to large bodies of water.

      "description": "<p><em>A wooden mask carved with a stoic leopard's features covers the face of this scholar. Her long cloak is embroidered with the names of fellow tribe members.</em></p>\n<p>The Tempest-Sun Mages are the chosen protectors of the Magaambya academy and the lands that surround it, watching from the skies for any sign of incursion approaching from the surrounding jungle. They are known as much for the close bonds that they form with their companions as for their extensive knowledge of magical forces, and many mages inscribe the names of important allies on their clothing or gear as reminders of the reason for their vigilance and dedication. The diligence and power of the Tempest-Sun Mages has ensured that no invading force has ever come within 20 miles of the university they defend.</p>\n<p>When the Tempest-Sun Mages are not defending the academy itself or accompanying envoys or teachers to distant locales, they use their mastery of arcane and primal magic to keep watch in the surrounding city and beyond, keeping an eye on the balance of power throughout the whole of the Mwangi Expanse. This magical intelligence often allows them to foresee threats to the academy or any nearby towns before such threats can even organize and approach.</p>\n<p>While Tempest-Sun Mages generally prefer to disable or incapacitate enemies, and readily call upon on their companions from the Uzunjati to reason with foes when possible, they do not hesitate to unleash lethal force against dangerous or implacable enemies, often taking to the air and raining down elemental fury. In particular, these mages have little tolerance for demons, having previously suffered attacks from the worshippers of the demon lord Angazhan who inhabit the city of Usaro.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Incredible events have rocked the lands of Avistan over the past 10 years, from whole cities reappearing out of a loop in time to magical explosions vaporizing the prison of Gallowspire. These marvels, both terrible and awe inspiring, inevitably attracted the attention of the Magaambya academy, home of scholars of magic in all its forms. Scholars, emissaries, and spies alike have now established Magaambyan centers in the north, seeking to learn and to help those they can along the way.</p>",

Whatever their specific reasons for joining the organization, armigers share the Hellknights' dedication to spreading the rule of law across Golarion. This commitment sees them serving in a variety of missions, whether it be rooting out bandits and crooks, imprisoning smugglers and black marketeers, or investigating rumors of sedition. While frontier villagers sometimes welcome the assurance of safety that the Hellknights bring, free thinkers and historians chafe at the restrictions on movement and expression that armigers enforce.</p>\n<p>Although armigers are not yet full knights, those who underestimate them have made a grievous error. Once ordered to take a position or eliminate a foe, an armiger is unerring in fulfilling their order. During battle, they wade eagerly into the fray, targeting servants of chaotic gods and those they observe using underhanded tactics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Firm believers in enforcing the law at any cost, Hellknights are often based in Cheliax, but they travel to all across Golarion to enforce their ideals of order. This rigid viewpoint and intolerance for dissent means that PCs can just as easily find villains in these Hellknights as they can allies; an agent of the Hellknight Order of the Chain might aid the PCs in subduing a vile and violent criminal, or might hunt down the PCs due to mild infractions of unjust laws. The Hellknight armiger presented here might be an unrepentant enforcer seeking to quell rebellion among the oppressed, a dedicated monster hunter, a censor of artistic innovation, a savior to victims of kidnapping, a spy and torturer, or a lawful crusader against demonic incursions. Hellknight paravicars, meanwhile, are absolute exemplars of their orders, and PCs who encounter them will likely find themselves in the midst of momentous events.</p>",

Though they seldom need to call upon them, paravicars use their considerable infernal powers to reinforce their positions in the Hellknight's hierarchy.</p>\n<p>In combat, paravicars take direct command of their troops of knights and armigers. Paravicars are experienced campaigners who prefer calculated tactical gambits to hot-headed, risky maneuvers that could leave their forces exposed. If pressed into combat, paravicars use their abilities to demoralize their foes and compel enemies to become their allies or to flee the field.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Firm believers in enforcing the law at any cost, Hellknights are often based in Cheliax, but they travel to all across Golarion to enforce their ideals of order. This rigid viewpoint and intolerance for dissent means that PCs can just as easily find villains in these Hellknights as they can allies; an agent of the Hellknight Order of the Chain might aid the PCs in subduing a vile and violent criminal, or might hunt down the PCs due to mild infractions of unjust laws. The Hellknight armiger presented here might be an unrepentant enforcer seeking to quell rebellion among the oppressed, a dedicated monster hunter, a censor of artistic innovation, a savior to victims of kidnapping, a spy and torturer, or a lawful crusader against demonic incursions. Hellknight paravicars, meanwhile, are absolute exemplars of their orders, and PCs who encounter them will likely find themselves in the midst of momentous events.</p>",

Generally found on the coast, azarketis favor life near a major body of water, as keeping their skin hydrated is a biological requirement. Though most azarketis live relatively peaceful lives of fishing or farming, they sometimes need to defend their homes against hostile forces, and some leave their communities to become adventurers. The following statistics may be used to represent commonly encountered azarketis.</p>\n<p>The most ambitious and capable azarketis become tide tamers, learning how to speak with aquatic animals and even train the strongest of these creatures to help defend their territory. Tide tamers act as guardians for their communities, scouts at sea and on the shore, or even entertainers for land-bound people's amusement. They're generally found with one or more aquatic allies whom they've befriended. Several serve alongside Absalom's Wave Riders as scouts, animal interlocutors, and guides.</p>",
