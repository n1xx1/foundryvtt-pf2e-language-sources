Generally found on the coast, azarketis favor life near a major body of water, as keeping their skin hydrated is a biological requirement. Though most azarketis live relatively peaceful lives of fishing or farming, they sometimes need to defend their homes against hostile forces, and some leave their communities to become adventurers. The following statistics may be used to represent commonly encountered azarketis.</p>\n<p>Azarketis with more adventurous spirits often learn the art of sailing and join the crew of a ship. Such sailors get to enjoy their time above deck while also having near-constant access to large bodies of water.

Her long cloak is embroidered with the names of fellow tribe members.</em></p>\n<p>The Tempest-Sun Mages are the chosen protectors of the Magaambya academy and the lands that surround it, watching from the skies for any sign of incursion approaching from the surrounding jungle. They are known as much for the close bonds that they form with their companions as for their extensive knowledge of magical forces, and many mages inscribe the names of important allies on their clothing or gear as reminders of the reason for their vigilance and dedication. The diligence and power of the Tempest-Sun Mages has ensured that no invading force has ever come within 20 miles of the university they defend.</p>\n<p>When the Tempest-Sun Mages are not defending the academy itself or accompanying envoys or teachers to distant locales, they use their mastery of arcane and primal magic to keep watch in the surrounding city and beyond, keeping an eye on the balance of power throughout the whole of the Mwangi Expanse. This magical intelligence often allows them to foresee threats to the academy or any nearby towns before such threats can even organize and approach.</p>\n<p>While Tempest-Sun Mages generally prefer to disable or incapacitate enemies, and readily call upon on their companions from the Uzunjati to reason with foes when possible, they do not hesitate to unleash lethal force against dangerous or implacable enemies, often taking to the air and raining down elemental fury. In particular, these mages have little tolerance for demons, having previously suffered attacks from the worshippers of the demon lord Angazhan who inhabit the city of Usaro.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Incredible events have rocked the lands of Avistan over the past 10 years, from whole cities reappearing out of a loop in time to magical explosions vaporizing the prison of Gallowspire. These marvels, both terrible and awe inspiring, inevitably attracted the attention of the Magaambya academy, home of scholars of magic in all its forms. Scholars, emissaries, and spies alike have now established Magaambyan centers in the north, seeking to learn and to help those they can along the way.</p>",
