A voracious but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed. The drakauthix's digestive process is entirely external-it clings to victims, and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow.</p>\n<p>The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals, and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn't above feasting on more active prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.</p>\n<p>Some Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for their flesh, which has a unique flavor with a peppery aftertaste.

It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name \"stirge\", possibly a corruption of the word \"scourge\", comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal \"tools\" to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been \"blessed\" by the village's hungry god.</p>\n<p>Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.</p>\n<p>Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.</p>\n<p>A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily in the air as it flies off to digest its meal.</p>",

      "description": "<p>These violently murderous fey have one purpose: to stealthily hunt down and slay humanoids brazen enough to dare set foot in the wilderness. Though they prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within.</p>\n<p>Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these \"pets\" poorly at best.</p>\n<p>There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey-for the most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company worth keeping.</p>\n<p>Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers won't stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it's just part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.</p>",

The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it's shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it's certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead-the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone-they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live.

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The majority of mummies were created by cruel and selfish masters to serve as guardians to protect their tombs from intruders. The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it's shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it's certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead-the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone-they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live. This burning rage only intensifies over the centuries of waiting within a crypt for the chance to actually act, and thus when most mummy guardians are awoken by tomb robbers or adventurers, they stop at nothing in pursuit of glorious slaughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While many cultures practice mummification of the dead for benign reasons, undead mummies are created through foul rituals, typically to provide eternally vigilant guardians.</p>",

A voracious but slow-moving hunter, the drakauthix prefers to ambush meaty creatures from above, using its hooked appendages to pull its victims upward to feed. The drakauthix's digestive process is entirely external-it clings to victims, and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow.</p>\n<p>The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals, and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn't above feasting on more active prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.</p>\n<p>Some Darklands-dwelling creatures, such as duergars, hunt drakauthixes for their flesh, which has a unique flavor with a peppery aftertaste.

Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups.

      "description": "<p>Scourges of swamps and damp, abandoned places, bloodseekers are ravenous blood drinkers. Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name \"stirge\", possibly a corruption of the word \"scourge\", comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal \"tools\" to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been \"blessed\" by the village's hungry god.</p>\n<p>Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.</p>\n<p>Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.</p>\n<p>A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily in the air as it flies off to digest its meal.</p>",

Even murder is merely another necessity, and they think nothing of creeping into a house, dispatching the residents, and taking what they want.</p>\n<p>Their chameleon-like ability to blend into their surroundings makes skulks difficult to detect, so their ever-present populations around the periphery of large settlements are nearly impossible to dislodge permanently. They typically travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared purpose for very long.</p>\n<p>Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around sewers and the like, are skulks' favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves' guild and become sought after for difficult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and overwhelming selfishness, however, usually means they are unable to secure long-lasting leadership roles.</p>\n<p>A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human. Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for eradication to the exclusion of all other victims.

Shulns' notoriously ill-tempered dispositions and their knack for digging into areas of an underground settlement where digging ought not occur makes them frustrating creatures to keep around, but when the alternative is an unpredictable but deadly visit from an enormous, hungry cave worm, the annoyances are well worth the trouble.</p>\n<p>Encounters with much larger shuln-like entities on the Plane of Earth suggest that these creatures may have originated from that place. The larger shulns still retain their elemental qualities, are quite a bit smarter, and have their own suite of earth-themed innate primal spells-but for all that, they still love the taste of cave worm.</p>",

Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.</p>",
