As they are well aware of and accommodating toward other humanoids' delicate sensibilities about arachnids, many anadis consider it rude to show their natural forms to a stranger. Instead, most display their spider-like forms only as an intimidation tactic when threatened, or in privacy to those they trust.</p>\n<p>Most anadi tend to be shy and seek to live quiet lives harvesting mushrooms and weaving beautiful, patterned silk cloth. When forced into combat-an eventuality most anadis despise-they shift into their hybrid forms as soon as possible, allowing them to inflict their devastating natural venom on their foes.</p>",

An aoyin dwells high in the mountains, rarely being seen by common folk. However, during lean winters, an aoyin might descend from its mountain home in search of food, resulting in gruesome encounters with nearby settlements. It's believed that a single aoyin can decimate the population of an entire village, only to retreat into the nearby mountains once it has satiated its hunger. An aoyin, even a herd of the creatures, is primarily driven by hunger and other natural urges. Outside of its natural habitat, an aoyin might occasionally be kept by those who revel in bloodlust. Even with magical control, a captive aoyin is more likely to turn on its handlers than obey commands. As an uncontrolled weapon, however, a hungry aoyin poses a terrible threat to most communities. Tales in certain isolated areas claim that the growling call of an aoyin can drive those unlucky enough to hear it into a frenzy of hunger and violence. Villages will be found consumed by infighting without any sign of an aoyin even entering its borders. Although it's possible a powerful variant of this creature might possess this ability, most of these stories are inspired by the terrible magic available to those who understand the aoyin's secrets and are spread when villages collapse through magic compulsions or mundane infighting.</p>",

Unlike mules found elsewhere on Golarion, augdunars are capable of producing offspring—though significantly fewer than ordinary equines. This has led to a steady, but controlled, stock of the creatures, allowing for the population to be selfsustaining. Augdunars are smaller than typical mules to accommodate dwarven height, measuring about four and a half feet tall and weighing between 400 and 600 pounds.</p>\n<p>Because of their ability to carry loads beyond that of the traditional mule, in addition to the ability to breed amongst themselves, augdunars are a frequent target of thieves or opportunistic merchants. No Highhelm citizen worth their stone willingly sells an augdunar to outsiders, so attempted thefts on the road are common. Unfortunately for these robbers, the mules are quite loyal to their owners and bray loudly whenever a stranger handles their leads. Combined with a heavy kick to the skull from the animal, any attempts to make off with an augdunar have low odds of succeeding.</p>\n<p>While rare, small groups of the augdunar have broken away from dwarven control over the years and created feral colonies in the Five Kings Mountains. These colonies are largely safe from ordinary predators, such as wolves, and graze on mountainside plants. Due to their low birthrate, feral augdunars don't need to have their population controlled, though caravanners do attempt to capture and redomesticate them in an effort to increase profit.</p>\n<p>Despite being natural beasts of burden, dwarves don't often use augdunars as mounts. The mules seem to have an instinctive dislike of riders, to which the deep bite marks and hoofprints left in those who try can attest. That's not to say that some haven't succeeded, however. Those who put forth the effort required to create a bond with an augdunar find that their persistence can pay off. Augdunar loyalty is unparalleled and even thieves know to not attempt to steal an augdunar that's carrying a rider.</p>",

The result is an aurosrath, a being so consumed with greed that they're unwilling to donate their corpse to the natural cycle.</p>\n<p>Popular lore surrounding the creation of an aurosrath often depicts a miser ironically crushed under the weight of their own gold. While such poetic origins can happen, the truth is often grimmer. Paranoia about potential thieves and freeloaders leads to isolation, both mental and physical.

Another starves, unable to escape the web of traps and barriers they've set up to defend their treasure from robbers.</p>\n<p>Heralded by the clinking of coins, an aurosrath appears as a bloated cadaver who's clad in faded finery, their bulk nearly bursting at the seams with tarnished coins. Their voices are typically a booming bass, their speech peppered with archaic upper-class turns of phrase. They are single-minded in their desire to accumulate wealth but can be reasoned with so long as they believe that goal will ultimately be satiated. An aurosrath can often be found haunting the estates they owned in life. As they brook no competition when it comes to accumulating wealth, they quickly turn to violence when encountering others of their kind.

Commonly called ice fey, these wintry tricksters are sadistic and without remorse in their desire to spread the cold wherever they go. Beirans find freezing temperatures to be the most comfortable; the fact that other creatures suffer under such conditions is part of the fun. While a single beiran is unlikely to change the temperature of a given space by more than a few degrees, they're highly social creatures, and it's uncommon to find fewer than a few dozen beirans at any one time.</p>\n<p>Though beirans are unapologetic in their rude nature, there's one type of creature they'll bow to and take orders from with no questions asked: winter hags. For reasons unknown, beirans are particularly subservient to these hags and will often flock to one in large numbers. Under a winter hag, the fey will make a bad cold snap worse for a suffering town. Fires will be extinguished, wood ruined, food stolen, all of which suit the mysterious tastes of the winter hag and her preference for joyless landscapes. What the beirans receive from this relationship is uncertain, though some fey academics believe it's possible that the first beirans were created by winter hags, much in the same way that the green men created leshies.</p>\n<p>While beirans are most common in northern lands such as Irrisen and the Land of the Linnorm Kings, they also have a surprising presence in the Shining Kingdoms. When Queen Elvanna of Irrisen opened up portals to the Eternal Winter of Irrisen, several of them arrived in the town of Heldren in Taldor, and even today, some still haunt the woods around it. Eighteen years ago in Falcon's Hollow, a particularly nasty batch of beirans were involved in the Carnival of Tears, an icy circus that left many townsfolk dead in its wake before adventurers dismantled it. Winters in Kyonin are often heralded by swarms of fiend-touched beirans flooding in from the Tanglebriar, leaving the Wylderhearts on fey duty for months at a time.</p>",

Thus, it doesn't take a bard to note that a bog dragon represents the most primal embodiment of their namesake. These dragons are as calm as the brackish waters, as perfectly patient as any crocodile mistaken for debris, and as ancient as any fear held of the realms they dwell within. To the many cultures they've stalked since the first humanoids dared to build their dwellings near brackish fens, a bog dragon is a terror consigned to the nebulous realm of monster and abomination. Though most have been relegated to the stuff of legends and the mythic nightmares of river valley city-states, bog dragons are still out there, lurking beneath the loam.</p>\n<p>Bog dragons haunt the parables of old, their primal characteristics a raw expression of a primeval world that rebukes the tyranny of time's progression. Their bodies are those of a belly-dragging thing, corpulent and richly shielded by a scabrous hide of spurs and spines. Their claws, much like their wings, are feeble things, vestiges of a more graceful draconic concept that only the eldest bog archdragon might attain. Their faces are masks of terror; their lips curl back in a snarl to expose brutish grins of dagger-like fangs, pock-marked by vicious stomach acids that give their latent breath the malodorous turpitude that stings the senses almost unto dizziness. They're every inch a night-going monstrosity, a harrowing horror that would drive terror into any who behold them, the pinnacle of marsh-born predators.</p>",

The people of Alkenstar typically find conventional arms sufficient for battling creatures who wander out of the Mana Wastes, but recent increases in activity from the fleshforges of Nex and the necromantic chambers of Geb have spurred the people of the city into a flurry of defensive innovations. Created by an experimental collaboration between the city's gunsmiths and clockwork inventors, the clockwork cannoneer provides exceptional mobile firepower. Two cannon-arms swing at the sides of the 15-foot-tall automaton, and its body contains a hopper of cannonballs that are replenished by engineers when the creature is wound up for duty. Triple-walled reinforcement on the cannoneer's black-powder reservoirs provides ample protection from the accidental explosions and backfires that often troubled early prototypes of the finely engineered machine. The current design combines the long-range capabilities of field artillery with the stopping power of a firedrake against engaged enemies, and its heat-tempered gear assembly minimizes warping that might cause slipping, grinding, or shaking.</p>\n<p>While reports from living artillery members serving alongside clockwork cannoneers complain of blisters, smoke inhalation, and singed eyebrows, the Grand Duchy's chief clockwork machinists have assured the city's leadership that the constructs function well within safety parameters. The clockwork cannoneer's self-sufficient construction frees crews to see to those battlefield tasks that can, for the moment, only be conducted by sentient beings.</p>\n<p>Intelligence reports from Quantium and Absalom indicate that attempts to replicate the clockwork cannoneer's design have been spectacularly unsuccessful.</p>",

Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining.

However, as most conspirator dragons meet others while in disguise, they do their best to maintain their disguise.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic. These dragons become more powerful as they age and strengthen their connections with their magical origins.

Each horn grows in a burst of searing flame that burns flesh and scales and results in a blackened obsidian spike jutting from its forehead. These horns molt off occasionally, leaving behind warnings of the beast's presence.</p>\n<p>In combat, Cuetzmonquali is a terrifying foe who uses its horns to skewer foes, unleashes white-hot blasts of flame to devastate those who don't approach, and injects a potent burning venom that ignites a foe from within their own body, sapping their strength. Against groups of weaker foes, it simply tramples them to death underfoot. Anyone courageous enough to face Cuetzmonquali and powerful or cunning enough to slay the creature can lay claim to the treasure that lies in its belly: the legendary artifact known as the <em>Spear of the Destroyer's Flame</em>.</p>",

Diabolic dragons, these scholars argue, are just extensions of the plane, living creatures that break off from Hell to enact its will. Whether this is true or whether diabolical dragons are simply the reborn souls of dragons sent to Hell, the fact remains that these dragons are powerful, cunning, and tyrannical. Every diabolic dragon's goal is to further Hell's will, though how this happens can vary. Regardless of their goals, these dragons always approach newcomers with an unsettling calmness.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic. These dragons become more powerful as they age and strengthen their connections with their magical origins. Scholars debate the classification of these dragons, with some preferring the name magical dragons and others using traditional dragons due to their connection to specific magical traditions. Regardless of their names, these dragons share a number of characteristics: their ability to tap into magical energies, intensified might and cunning as they grow older, and an inclination to hoard vast amounts of treasure and wealth.</p>\n<h2>Draconic Spellcasters</h2>\n<p>Each dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon's Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give them the spells outlined in their sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each rank. You might also want to increase the dragon's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.</p>",

Native to the underground tunnels of the Five Kings Mountains, the reptiles have been domesticated to serve as beasts of burden within the Depths and sprawling web of passages beyond. Zoologists theorize that they are a part of the same reptile family as zetogekis, as the two share a similar build and other physical characteristics.</p>\n<p>Draft lizards within the vicinity of Highhelm have adapted their diet to feed mainly on grindlegrubs. However, residual behavior suggests in lean times or before domestication they would devour stones for sustenance. The animals can still be observed habitually gnawing on boulders or large stones, cracking them with their powerful jaws and seeming to savor the taste as they roll the debris around in their mouths. Overworked draft lizards will stray from their handler's control in order to consume rocks, only to return back to their path with a new undercurrent of purpose.</p>\n<p>Normally as docile as any other beast of burden, the draft lizards of Highhelm will defend themselves if attacked by predators from the Darklands. Curiously, the lizards have an intense hatred for hryngars, attacking them without any prompting or hesitation. No dwarven records indicate teaching this behavior during the domestication of the animals, leaving its origins a mystery. Some caravanners even claim that the reptiles can sense the presence of hryngars, giving advanced warning of attacks by hissing menacingly into the darkness.</p>\n<p>Though too large to be exceptionally dexterous, with careful training some draft lizards can be taught performative tricks. The Rolling Wheel is particularly known for a trio of reptiles that balance on their tails, catch hurled boulders in their jaws, and other stunts. The spectacle is well known in Highhelm, considered one of the big acts that the group performs. This has led to some younger dwarves attempting to teach their animals the same feats, mostly resulting in failure and light property damage in the Depths.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Legends state the first executor dragons formed from the rage-filled screams of Sarenrae during her struggle against the Rough Beast. In the face of an enemy even she had no hope of redeeming, the ever-compassionate Dawnflower allowed her divine fury to escape from her lips as she struck down the primordial god, and from this act of anathema, the first executor dragons were given form. Since that moment, executor dragons represent the full wrath of the gods. Divine in nature, executor dragons typically appear to punish those who have strayed so far from the path of their deity's edicts as to begin embracing the anathema. Due to their potent nature as weapons of the divine, executor dragons are generally drawn to target not a single misbehaving follower, but entire villages, cities, or towns that have turned their backs on their gods. Many of the gods prefer not to use executor dragons as part of their punishment of mortal transgressors, and instead keep them reserved for the days of apocalyptic battles.</p>\n<p>Though many believe executor dragons are spawned from divine magic, they are fully biological creatures. Compelled by faith and devotion and disgusted by hypocrisy and base cruelty, executor dragons tend to live near human settlements, but rarely within them. They form small familial groups when young, but grow more independent as they age, seeking to claim territory uninhabited by other dragons. Their chosen lairs tend to be locations secreted away, either in the ruins of mountaintop monasteries or in the cavernous depths beneath abandoned places of worship. For the few executor dragons that live actively among non-draconic peoples, even fewer do so in their natural forms. They are sometimes found living disguised as traveling lay priests who bring healing and alms for the needy, choristers singing hymnals, wandering monastic scholars who ask challenging and conflicted questions about faith, or quiet church custodians who protect and beautify their chosen houses of worship. It's said that one or more executor dragons might have even taken up the defense of Kenebres after its near destruction at the hands of the Khorramzadeh, Storm King of the Worldwound.</p>",

Every detail of the creature's physiology was fashioned for the battlefield, from the ballista of bone and sinew integrated into its torso to the bulky ram on the crest of its head. The fleshforged's acidic blood not only serves an important hydraulic function but also deters city defenders who might attempt to strike down the creature.</p>\n<p>During the war between Nex and Geb, fleshforged dreadnoughts most often appeared as part of a coordinated assault and typically replaced or augmented an army's compliment of siege weaponry. Common tactics employed by Nex's generals would direct the dreadnought to crush all opposition standing in front of a city's gate and then smash through it. Should the city's defenses prove resilient, invading troops would scale the creature to get over the city walls, relying on the dreadnought's regenerative properties to ensure it wouldn't be destroyed while helping them bypass the defensive barriers.</p>\n<p>Fleshforged dreadnoughts all but vanished after the disappearance of the archmage Nex, but tales of their destructive power have been preserved.</p>",

These terrifying creatures mimic their natural surroundings to ambush greedy adventurers.</p>\n<p>A Taldan alchemist created the goldpebble with the ultimate goal of breeding a creature capable of reproducing at a high rate while possessing a body that would turn to gold upon death, effectively ensuring an endless supply of wealth. Initially, the experiments were successful, with each shed of the snake's skin producing trace amounts of gold. As the snakes grew, however, the amount of gold didn't, and the snakes themselves soon proved unwieldy and difficult to contain. Unhindered, the alchemist redoubled her efforts, adding alchemical reagents to her experiments and leaning more heavily into inhumane tactics to produce her desired results. These tactics failed to lead to an increase in the amount of gold produced but instead mutated the creatures' venom, giving them the ability to slowly turn a victim's blood to frozen water. Empowered with this new ability, the goldpebbles felled their own creator and escaped to spread across the Inner Sea region.</p>\n<p>Goldpebbles are generally solitary creatures except for their biannual mating season. During this time, they're even more dangerous than usual, becoming territorial and protective of their young while attacking in groups. Once the eggs hatch, the breeding grounds are filled with hundreds of tiny snakes slithering in all directions in search of new territory. These young goldpebbles are less in control of their alchemical powers than their adult counterparts and have the potential to freeze the water around them at a moment's notice.</p>\n<p>Goldpebbles rely heavily on ambush tactics. Often found hiding in shallow pools, rivers, and lakes, goldpebbles will lure unsuspecting adventurers to their lairs using their gold-flecked scales. Once within reach, goldpebbles attack with a gruesome bite that can poison an unlucky victim, slowly turning their prey's blood into freezing water. Goldpebbles can also chill the waters around them, making it incredibly difficult for prey to survive.</p>",

Horned dragons use their horns to impale their prey in a quick and brutal display of their might. They are generally contemplative and have a fixation on knowledge and self-discipline, traits belied by their bestial appearance. As a result, horned dragons are generally more open to speaking with outsiders.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic. These dragons become more powerful as they age and strengthen their connections with their magical origins. Scholars debate the classification of these dragons, with some preferring the name magical dragons and others using traditional dragons due to their connection to specific magical traditions. Regardless of their names, these dragons share a number of characteristics: their ability to tap into magical energies, intensified might and cunning as they grow older, and an inclination to hoard vast amounts of treasure and wealth.</p>",

According to the legend, the wizard was too successful and ended up being the flrst victim of the beast. Today, owlbears can be found around the world, with a variety of features. While the most common subspecies looks like a brown bear with the features of a great horned owl, owlbears from the frozen north might resemble polar bears mixed with snowy owls, and in temperate rain forests they might resemble black bears with the heads of barn owls.</p>\n<p>Most owlbears live solitary lives, gathering only to mate and raise cubs, which are hatched from eggs. An owlbear's territory usually extends to around 5 miles from its lair, with clear signs of its habitat appearing with 1 mile (clawed up trees, gigantic feathers, and shredded carcasses). The lair of an owlbear rarely holds anything of value, but some adventurers have found trinkets, coins, and even jewelry in the massive pellets of undigested bones these monsters leave behind.</p>",

True or not, jiidons are seemingly normal rats who share the blessing from this story. It's unclear where the first jiidon was born because their descendants live among rat and humanoid populations around the world. In their original forms, jiidons are extremely difficult to distinguish from an ordinary rat and often even finds a home leading its non-sapient kin.</p>\n<p>After eating the discarded fingernails of a humanoid, however, a jiidon can assume the shape of the clippings' owner, resembling the subject in all of the obvious and superficial ways, with several subtle differences. Their ears are a little larger and sometimes come to a small point. Their teeth continue to grow for their entire lifetimes, so they must regularly chew on stones, bark, and other hard materials to file their teeth down and conceal their true nature. The whiskers that grow from the sides of their faces also require daily trimming.</p>\n<p>Jiidons are mostly harmless, but their powers provoke alarm among those who know of them. Mothers scold their children not to clip their nails after nightfall, lest a lurking jiidon seize a sliver that got lost in the dark. Though as cautious as any rat, most jiidons want nothing more than to transform and take a place in humanoid society. In order to reduce suspicion, they've been known to target those who are unpopular among their neighbors. The gratitude they feel when they do replace a humanoid can sometimes be seen in their actions, revealing the fact that the target has been replaced or endearing jiidons to those who didn't appreciate the original's attitude.</p>\n<p>Jiidons from large families will often seek a role that grants them access to nail trimmings, such as a cleaner or doctor, and pass the gift of humanoid form through the family.</p>",

This duty prevents those who die tragic or violent deaths from becoming bound to the world as ghosts—a mercy, though one often unappreciated by the wards of joseung sajas.

A faint shimmer in the air, like the waves over a hot stone, hints at where their other half would be.</p>\n<p>Despite the bizarre appearance of the k'nonna, they have no trouble balancing or performing everyday tasks that might be impeded by missing half of their bodies. They are extremely dexterous, able to perform complex tasks with only a single hand. The nature of their missing half has so far defied explanation; it is not invisible, nor does it exist on another plane, yet it seems to exert enough force for a k'nonna to walk like a human being.</p>\n<p>No one is certain of the k'nonna's origins, except that they are not of this world and not descended from any known mortal creature. Banishment magic has no effect on them, implying they do not come from another plane. They are intelligent but difficult to communicate with-they speak only in half words and hear only half of what anyone says. K'nonna are also much less interested in talking than eating, and humanoids happen to be their favorite meal. The remains of a k'nonna's victim are unmistakable, as they only consume half the body.</p>\n<p>Stories tell of the half-people's love for gifts, especially jewelry. Offerings of rings and necklaces easily distract a k'nonna long enough for prey to escape. Particularly bold victims might try to trick a k'nonna into wearing a bracelet that binds their one visible wrist or ankle to immobilize them, though the tactic is not foolproof, as a k'nonna displeased with their gifts will hunt the person who displeased them for the rest of their days.</p>",

Their broad wings conceal a pair of wiry humanoid arms that end in clawed fingers, which they use to dig through burial sites in search of corpses. The fell purpose of this is still a mystery, though most believe that karinas make off with these dead bodies to consume them in the safety of their lairs. The difficulty of tracking the beasts, as well as the danger, makes it difficult to know for sure.</p>\n<p>A karina's terrifying appearance suggests that they're not natural creatures. Many legends claim that karinas first flew out of Abaddon to the Material Plane to consume the corpses of the first mortals, while others state that the first karina was born from the soul of the first mortal who partook in cannibalism. The power of good repulses karinas, suggesting an evil or fiendish origin.</p>\n<p>Karinas are plague carriers and intentionally attack creatures to spread their own personal pestilence. The supernatural disease they carry, known as grave blight, causes fever, disorientation, and (at later stages) an innate desire to attack others and spread the disease. Karinas revel in the slow collapse of villages, lurking in the surrounding jungle to observe every miserable moment. As the locals bury their dead, the karinas swoop in to steal the corpses.</p>\n<p>In addition to carrying a terrible disease, karinas also have the ability to mimic voices. They typically repeat phrases they've heard, but twist the voice into a fiendish corruption of the original. Intelligent enough to recognize the friends and family of a possible target, a karina will use the mocking voice of a loved one to frighten them. When terrorizing a village, they generally work together in groups of two or three.</p>",

They took a small gem and wrote a word of power upon it. They gave it eyes so it could see and legs so it could walk, and made it wise. These creatures are known as kaseshi by scholars who have encountered them, though their true name—the one that brought them into being—is likely considerably more powerful.</p>\n<p>Each kasesh bears a single word of power on their emerald body, from which they draw their mind and their magic. A kasesh with the word \"Steel\" or \"Flame\" is a single-minded creature, though it encompasses all possible permutations of meaning that the word possesses. A kasesh named \"Home\" or \"Sorrow\" has a far more complex psyche, and rumor claims that Elder Architect Oblosk of Nex bears the word \"Memory.\" Unsurprisingly, many scholars are highly interested in the words on the kaseshi; unlike Thassilonian rune magic, no one has managed to decode or make use of the language of the Vault Builders yet.</p>\n<p>The kasesh in the stat block bears the word \"Stone,\" but other kaseshi will have their own magics.

However, chaotic environments can overwhelm and overstimulate kashrishi not yet adept at filtering psychic energies, leaving some with limited tolerance for extensive social interaction with strangers and requiring they take periods of time to refocus after socializing.

His long, greasy tongue continually flickers out from his mouth, occasionally licking droplets of spittle from his dark brown fur. He wields a set of iron chains that act as an extension of his will. Krampus is never seen without a wicker basket draped over one shoulder, its bottom often stained with the blood of his victims. Krampus stands a little over 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Krampus's origin is unknown; residents of the small towns and villages he terrorizes in northern Irrisen believe the creature has always existed, coming forth once a year to punish those he deems wicked. While many legends have been told about Krampus's beginning, the most popular of them starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After a series of harsh winters that the townsfolk barely survived, they began to doubt the power of the druids and their rituals. As the villagers grew more resentful, the druid circle took drastic action. Under the light of a blue moon, the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and called forth the most powerful spiritual essence they could, and a new creature was born-Krampus. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' bitter resentment and doubt. Instead of a central figure to lead them in winter celebrations, as they had hoped, the druids had spawned a monster who sought to punish those who had behaved selfishly during lean times.</p>\n<p>Recognizing their error, the druids sought to banish their creation. They tracked Krampus down as he slept and shackled him in cold iron chains, hoping to subdue him and force him back to the First World. But Krampus was no fey, and cold iron held no power over him. When he awoke, he ripped the chains free, claimed them as his own, and tracked down the druids who had dared try to capture him. After their betrayal, Krampus can see no good in any mortal and longs only to punish the wicked for their selfish misdeeds.</p>\n<p>To this day, Krampus takes vicious delight in transforming his victims into the petulant children before killing them, and no manner of sacrifice can appease him. Luckily for any nearby villages, Krampus stalks their streets but once a year.</p>\n<p>Locals believe that Krampus makes his lair among the deep crevasses of ice somewhere within the Winterwall Glacier, which lines Avistan's northernmost reaches. No adventurer has yet braved the treacherous expanse to find and defeat him.</p>\n<p>While Krampus is most infamous for tracking and punishing the naughty, his own sins often inform his vindictive responses to others' misdeeds. An incarnation of Krampus who arose from irrepressible greed might possess abilities that better reflect his fierce miserly behavior, emphasizing less the abduction of miscreants and more the disproportionate punishment of thieves and robbers. Such a variant Krampus might arise in different cultures that tell different stories about Krampus, or Krampus's powers and nature might drift between incarnations each time he is defeated and arises anew elsewhere in the world the following year. In these cultures or incarnations, Krampus represents a remorseless yet generous spirit who's willing to grant boons to the truly worthy while tormenting any who fail his morality tests.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for people in regions terrorized by this Krampus, his definition of \"any who fail his morality tests\" tend to be nearly everyone but the most innocent and generous of people.</p>",

An acrid stench of burning manure follows the creature, often serving as the only warning that anyone gets before it attacks.</p>\n<p>Despite their fungal nature, Melfesh Monsters are undamaged by their own jets of flame and resistant to fires set by others, often surprising hunters who paid too little attention to the legends before encountering the creature. Their terrifying spores also mean that most survivors of their attacks tend to be disoriented and delirious, relating accounts of the monster that are distorted by confusion and fear. This, along with the natural variance between different Melfesh Monsters, means that even the most diligent of researchers will come across contradictory evidence. Even if they learn from all the prior information collected over the years, they're still often caught off guard when trying to hunt down and fell the threat since the new Melfesh Monster might have an ability never seen before. The canniest researchers, when faced with the seemingly contradictory evidence, speculate that the creature might evolve or change over time, which is closer to the truth but still falls short.</p>",

Fleshy, ribbed mosquito wings protrude from her back. She has six handless arms that taper into malformed points, which she keeps clutched to her chest like the legs of an insect's pupae. Her spindly legs also taper into points; when bloated from feeding, she must run on all eight limbs, which leave small holes in the ground as tracks.</p>\n<h2>The Swarm Seer</h2>\n<p>Few have seen the Mosquito Witch, yet almost everyone has suffered her namesake vermin at some point in time. Shimmerford summer skies shimmer with flies hatching from the river and myriad creeks, and \"wherever pests fly, the Witch can spy.\" In her Swarm Seer aspect, the Mosquito Witch is a haunting predator and verminous voyeur whose sanguineous appetites are equal to her fascination with societies. She keeps tabs on every inhabitant with parasocial glee, obsessing over their superstitions and abandoned trinkets-especially any representations of herself.</p>\n<p>This Mosquito Witch rarely acts with outright malice or to bring direct harm to those around her. However, her haunting appearance, alien values, and tendency to express emotions with sky-blotting swarms inspires terror in her neighbors. Depending on the circumstances she might represent a fearsome and ineffable ally, a demigod of fecundity, or a terrible foe who long ago lost patience with humanity.</p>",

This reputation for bringing fortune—which the dragonets encourage—has led to the popularity of good-luck charms featuring this plump dragonet species and the belief that harming a pearl dragonet can incur a lifetime of ill luck.</p>\n<p>Pearl dragonets have pearlescent scales and a round body with stumpy legs. Their minute wings cannot support flight, so they rely on magic to fly. They have long tails that can be up to five times the length of their bodies. This odd build exacerbates their ungainly, waddling gait, which is punctuated by head-over-heel rolls and erratic flight paths.</p>\n<p>Pearl dragonets are attentive, with an acute ability to understand the world around them. They are commonly found in the mountains of Tian Xia, living close to remote or insular highland communities that show due respect for their insight. Communities seeking to attract pearl dragonets often hang up round, red paper lanterns, though both the dragonets and the villagers take minor offense toward anyone who compares the relative shape of the dragonets and the lanterns.</p><hr /><p>Though dragonets are smaller and lacking the raw power of great dragons, they are every bit as varied and fascinating as their larger relatives.

Pest drakes, for instance, are weak and shy individually but are inclined to form dangerous swarms when unsettled. By contrast, pearl dragonets are gentle oddities that seem naturally friendly.</p>\n<p>Dragonets range in size from little bigger than songbirds to no larger than house cats. Unlike most great dragons, they stop growing after reaching maturity.

These twin golems ceaselessly keep vigil over the city, ready to cut down any invaders that menace Quantium.</p>\n<p>Twenty feet tall and crafted from a supernaturally smooth material, the two guardians are a matched set, one of crimson and one of emerald. Wielding swords the size of giants, the guardians relentlessly destroy anything that threatens the city, particularly any undead that might invade the country from Geb. With the mythic Crux of Nex as a power supply, the golems are inexhaustible and nearly indestructible.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Most commonly found in Vudra and Jalmeray, ratajin aren't so much twisted by curses as they are molded by the lingering effects of curses inflicted on generations millennia past. The difference lies in understanding the original ratajin characteristics. No curse gave ratajin four eyes on a slender face, nor triple-jointed, hypermobile legs and multiple arms. Nor did curses provide ratajin with skin tones of all hues within the color spectrum. Instead, these residual curses have given each ratajin distinctive geometric markings all across their body. Every ratajin also experiences a cursed twist on their senses, altering how they view and interact with the world around them. Some ratajin visualize the world in shifted, indescribable color spectra. For others, sounds physically manifest as feelings on their skin. Haunting melodies of past actions might whisper in the wind behind one ratajin, while another can be awake only during hours devoid of sunlight.</p>\n<p>While particular curse manifestations are passed along family lines, each ratajin's worldview can offer a unique perspective. Ratajin tend to be receptive to new ideas, making them well-suited to tackle complex situations. They often prefer to focus on difficult problems, working without rest until they reach a solution. What satisfies the definition of a worthy pursuit varies with individual ratajin, from tinkering with new applications of technology to uncovering secrets of centuries-old magical tomes. Their intellectual approach to problems can make ratajin especially useful in situations requiring delicate words, and their quick thinking serves them well as adventurers when the time comes for action. These same characteristics also make them capable merchants and scholars.</p>\n<p>Earning a ratajin's trust can prove difficult. Their large-scale communities often collaborate to devise clever solutions that ensure equitable treatment among people, but each community varies greatly due to the different needs of the inhabitants. Outsiders who require too much help too quickly might cause a ratajin to withdraw, believing their guest incapable of adjusting to life's many hurdles. Poorly chosen words of pity or meaningless sympathy toward the nature of a ratajin's unique sensory experience can also cause lingering resentment.</p>",

These hardy creatures have adapted to harsh arctic climates, able to survive indefinitely in sub-zero temperatures.

They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey. Due to their natural lower body temperature, they can slow their digestive tract, which allows them to live a long time on little food. Large prey—such as whales, caribou, or moose—offer the best sustenance, but they aren't picky when it's time to eat.</p>\n<p>Rime dragons have a deep curiosity for things hidden and lost in the ice. The ocean's currents bring all kinds of artifacts from across the world to their frigid waters. Self-described caretakers and scholars, rime dragons search the arctic regions for ancient antiquities. Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them. They also act as paleopathologists, studying ancient diseases that could cause havoc if they were brought back to a populace unknowingly. These they carefully contain while researching mitigation strategies should the pathogens be reintroduced to the world.</p>",

A rompo tends to be timid on its own; it avoids other creatures and typically flees in the presence of larger animals. Though no more intelligent than any other beast, it usually acts with extreme paranoia, dodging traps or ambushes with an uncanny acumen. When danger is present, a rompo utters a loud cry to afford itself space to run and hides by using its body's natural color-shifting fur as camouflage.</p>\n<p>Although rompos sport the perfect physical features to act as predators, they tend to live their lives as solitary scavengers of leftover corpses. Rompos prefer to avoid hunting for themselves since they risk sustaining injuries in the process. It's not uncommon for rompos to follow other predators for hours, waiting for an opportunity to feast on the leftover remains of a hunt.</p>\n<p>Once a rompo gains access to a meal, it takes several minutes circling the corpse to make sure the area is clear. As it begins to feast, it lets out a whimpering cry that fascinates and compels other creatures to keep away so that the rompo can feed in peace. Due to its constant feeding on decaying flesh, a rompo's mouth is filled with rot, parasites, and deadly pathogens. Its bite can impart these combined infections as a dangerous disease known as rompo chills. The disease causes its victim to tremble uncontrollably, lightly at first but eventually developing into a violent shaking that ends with the victim's death. Despite their cautious nature, rompos always seem to linger close to creatures they infect with rompo chills; though they remain unseen while the victim lives, they emerge when that victim finally succumbs, in order to feed on the corpse.</p>",

They typically don't cast spells themselves, instead relying on their ability to create runes on the fly to produce desired effects. A rune dragon often refers to their hoard as their library, as it's full of important historical texts, plays, speeches, textbooks, and spellbooks written by people of different cultures in a variety of languages. While they can often speak a language with the aid of magic, they much prefer to learn languages in the context of their speakers so they can grasp the nuances hidden within the syntax and the magic within their symbols.</p>",

In contrast, when they're angered, the storm spares none from its fury.</p>\n<p>Despite common Tian belief, civilization hardly lives at the mercy of the sea dragons, for most are subjects of kingdoms sworn to assist mortals. Most sea dragons are subjects of one of the four sea dragon kings, whose nation or united territories are based out in the Embaral Ocean, Ivory Sea, Okaiyo Ocean, and Songil Sea. Given the lack of native sea dragons on the Plane of Water, it's theorized that these kingdoms might be remnants of a mass exodus from the Boundless Sea. The sea dragon's own myths say their kings of old took oaths to escape persecution from the Elemental Lord Kelizandri.

They can be found digging up grave sites, shoveling the earth and breaking into caskets or tombs with their massive, hooked beaks, as well as lurking at execution sites, burial mounds, or feeding on travelers' corpses left behind on roadsides.</p>\n<p>Due to their size, shape, and propensity for burial grounds, it isn't uncommon for a shroudwing to be mistaken for a grieving widow when seen at a distance—only when an unfortunate creature gets close enough does it discover the danger it's in. Though not predatory or outright aggressive, shroudwings are exceptionally territorial; they'll protect and defend both their feeding site as well as their nesting area from anyone who might trespass upon it.</p>\n<p>While many might know these unusual birds by name and sight, even more know the shroudwing by sound. When threatened, the shroudwing emits a haunting, fear-inducing death rattle that can be heard for miles. They prefer nesting in covered brush, and their mating season occurs in the winter months.

Skinskitters, named for their fluid, erratic movements, scavenge the city for leavings of fleshy waste. They prefer discreet, non-violent ways of procuring these biological materials and shy from combat, seemingly possessed of a nervous temperament. Nexian fleshforgers quip this is entirely reasonable, as skinskitters are little more than nervous systems wrapped in dying skin. Nexian guards who actually have to hunt these fleshforged pests aren't quite as jocular; confronted by the oddly childlike pleas of these cornered puddles of flesh, hair, and eyes, many recruits simply choose to leave the city watch.</p>\n<p>On occasion, curious scholars or soldiers have questioned why skinskitters pursue organic tissue, and whether this is a simple instinct or in pursuit of a grander purpose. Most fleshforgers assume that skinskitters consume organic matter to repair themselves in a process similar to eating, and give the matter no further thought, showing no more interest in the creatures than a smith might show in a bead of melted slag. The most paranoid Nexians claim that skinskitters are attempting to build something out of their collections of cast-off skin, perhaps even reconstructing themselves into fleshforged conformers. There is no recorded evidence of this ever occurring, however—if the creatures have any awareness at all, it's more likely that skinskitters are driven by the basest of instincts to better themselves through the same methods used in their creation but lack the understanding and self-direction to ever succeed.</p>",

The presence of these avatars is often the only way to track these reclusive and solitary creatures. Should the solar ibis choose to appear, these little birds scatter like wild fowl. The sun bird then manifests and bathes the area in a brilliant shower of light that can blind and startle unwary and unprepared creatures in its presence.</p>\n<p>The solar ibis appears as a magnificent, large bird surrounded by a halo of brilliant light. Its black feathers shimmer with all the colors of the spectrum, casting glossy rainbows across its plumage. It has a keen sense of insight, which it uses to pass judgment as a whole on whether those before it are worthy to access what it guards. It punishes those it finds unworthy with its cleansing might.</p>\n<p>Though considered sacred by most within the Mwangi Expanse, there are still some who hunt these glorious creatures; some seek the treasures that the ibis keep, while others seek the ibis themselves, dead or alive. Some believe that the feathers of a solar ibis, when burned, create an incense that can grant holy power to those that inhale it.

Instead, he's one of a rare type of fey native to the First World who enjoy causing bloody mayhem in the Material Plane. These fey are so rare and so distrustful of one another's company that two have never been seen together; the mistaken assumption that only a single Spring-Heeled Jack exists is therefore entirely understandable. The fact that sightings occur across Ustalav (and beyond) and across centuries of time is ascribed to the trickster's long lifespan and mysterious ability to travel quickly, or to the belief that there's no such creature, merely an urban legend that twisted minds attempt to bring to life through costumes, magic, and a series of murders and mayhem. Even in fear-drenched Ustalav, no one has yet guessed that multiple Spring-Heeled Jacks exist or postulated that some future event might drive them to overcome their mutual disdain and gather into a murderous cabal, far more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks are cruel-eyed, hairy fey with vaguely humanoid shapes and extra features that cause them to be easily mistaken for demons or devils. Glowing eyes, cloven hooves, menacing horns, and a pointed tail combine to create the mien of a wicked imp; his love of sudden and sadistic violence completes the impression. Almost all have jet-black skin and fur, though a few exceptions might exist.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks typically hide their features in tattered cloaks, appearing as a hunched elder or a youth in the nighttime conditions they enjoy. Such a disguise rarely holds up to any scrutiny, but that doesn't matter much to the Spring-Heeled Jack, who only needs something that offers just enough doubt for their target to move within striking distance, which can be from much farther away than most other creatures even realize. Once close enough, the Spring-Heeled Jack leaps startling distances in the blink of an eye to easily slash at a victim who had, until that moment, considered themself safe.</p>",

The Great Flood towers with their giant serpent body and nine humanoid heads, each one with a different personality, though all serve the same purpose—to vanquish all signs of life that shouldn't be where they are. This creature intends to maintain the balance of the universe, ensuring that nothing takes up more space than necessary. Unfortunately, the judgment of where someone or something should be is only seen and weighed by the 18 eyes of the Great Flood, with little regard to mortal input.</p>\n<p>The Great Flood is an immortal, or at least ageless, being who hibernates for 12 years at a stretch. On the thirteenth year, they emerge from the depths of the oceans and begin weighing the state of the world and the environments closest to their resting place: should the first thing they see on dry land be destroyed? Each of the Great Flood's nine heads lends their thoughts and insights to this deliberation, and upon reaching a consensus, they'll either carry on to the next location or they'll drown the land, immersing miles of dry land in salty waters from the ocean. In instances where they perceive the excess life as particularly problematic, they'll even decide to poison the waters with their bitter breath to ensure that nothing survives the judgment they've decreed. The Great Flood, despite its inherently destructive nature, isn't actually bloodthirsty and will often afford an opportunity for poor townsfolk to state their case and beg for the lives of their town to be saved. While the Great Flood has the capacity for mercy and consideration, the godlike creature stands adamant once they've made their decision. One or two of the heads might feel a twinge of guilt and tell a small joke to the townsfolk, relieving themselves of the mental pressure, before murdering an entire village.</p>\n<p>The nine personalities of the serpentine creature often run into contention with each other. One is a perfectionist, while another is aloof; one is assertive, while another is playful; one is capricious, while another is suspicious; one is ambitious, while the other is a people pleaser. The last one is quiet and secretive, only ever whispering to the heads closest to them. Though the heads squabble like siblings, they eventually always make a compromise.</p>",

Found in the marine environments that their name suggests, tidepool dragonets have strong jaws adapted to cracking open shells. While shellfish are their main food source, they are adaptive foragers. They'll happily catch and eat octopuses, tidal fish, starfish, sea anemones, and seabirds if the opportunity arises. Their long, webbed claws make them nimble hunters and allow them to reach into rocky recesses. They have muscular wings that work well both above and below water.</p>\n<p>Tidepool dragonets are proud bullies who habitually harass wildlife and fishers. They frequently steal brightly painted floats, flags, and shiny hooks to decorate their tidal caves. Prized pieces are reserved for ornamenting themselves, and they cover their scales with shards of glass, necklaces of coral, or crowns of silverware retrieved from wrecks.</p><hr /><p>Though dragonets are smaller and lacking the raw power of great dragons, they are every bit as varied and fascinating as their larger relatives. Like dragons, dragonets have strong ties to magic. These ties influence the contrasting natures exhibited by different dragonet types. For example, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core.Actor.QIXc18xHrEWDmtKW]{Fey Dragonets} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core-2.Actor.Zh8awPHA7DZxTboc]{House Drakes} make fascinating pets and companions, and thus are a popular familiar for spellcasters. Tidepool dragonets, on the other hand, are arrogant and untamable.</p>\n<p>Assuming dragonets are harmless due to their size, or the fact that they often live near people, is dangerous. Pest drakes, for instance, are weak and shy individually but are inclined to form dangerous swarms when unsettled. By contrast, pearl dragonets are gentle oddities that seem naturally friendly.</p>\n<p>Dragonets range in size from little bigger than songbirds to no larger than house cats. Unlike most great dragons, they stop growing after reaching maturity. They vary greatly in intelligence; fey dragonets are known for their tricks and wit, while feral racing drakes have the average problem solving capacity of a pigeon.

Ugvashi first arrived in the Impossible Lands onboard the Thousand and One ships of Maharajah Khiben-Sald, alongside peafowl, giant squirrels, and other fauna from Vudra. In the modern day, ugvashi are such a recognized sight that many people forget they aren't a native species. Though some feral populations exist, mainly on the island of Jalmeray, the hostile environs of Nex and the Mana Wastes mean ugvashi mainly appear in domestic settings, usually as working beasts among the Nearic halflings of western Nex.</p>\n<p>Though ugvashi are mostly harmless, they're somewhat more dangerous than their smaller cousins, causing a stir when reckless citizens attempt to pet the creatures. Ugvashi scales are razor sharp, and their large and blunted digging claws can be deadly due to their size. People who attempt to steal the animals or ride them without training often receive moderate cuts for their trouble. However, ugvashi are generally curious and very friendly, and more than one visitor or wilderness explorer has found a baby ugvashi toddling after them and pawing at their boots.</p>\n<p>Nearic halflings also paint their ugvashi with distinctive warding patterns and sigils, some of which are actually effective and provide a surprise for opportunistic thieves or predators. Though due consideration is spent on protecting an ugvashi's cargo, the animals themselves have proven to be tempting targets as well, especially for their meat. With blighted landscapes making animal husbandry impractical and magical pollution leaving local seafood with a distinct aftertaste, a number of Nexian and Mana Wastes peoples have developed a taste for ugvashi. Since the animals lack an aggressive temperament, it often falls to their caretakers to discourage such predations through whatever means necessary.</p>\n<p>Ugvashi shed their scales each winter, allowing for the plates to be collected safely and turned into quality armor and other pieces of craftwork. Nearic halflings rarely trade or sell these items, however, out of fear that they might lead to more people trying to steal their ugvashi.</p>",

Natives of the Netherworld, these occult dragons are at home in the darkness, using it to their advantage both in and out of battle. Umbral dragons rarely worry about fighting fairly, emerging from hiding to strike unwary foes and using their magical breath without compunction. Similarly, in social situations, they often remain in the shadows, operating through other creatures. Even in direct conversation, they frequently obscure their true intent, preferring to avoid ever being pinned down with a solid answer.</p>\n<p>While umbral dragons are rarely altruistic, their preferred diet creates a strange dichotomy that attracts other creatures to them as a potential source of safety, especially in the Netherworld. While much of the multiverse sees undead as a dire threat, for umbral dragons, undead are a tasty snack. Umbral dragons find the flavor of necrotic flesh irresistible and the void energy of incorporeal undead a potent spice, making them one of the few creatures in existence known to hunt the unliving as a source of food.</p>",

When that very first blade went snicker-snack for the very first time, tasting the primeval lifeblood of the draconic Tane, the first vorpal dragon was born.</p>\n<p>Vorpal dragons are most notorious for their keen vorpal magic. Even the least of these dragons can sever a foe's head in a single lucky stroke. Unusually, however, the subject survives as a bipartite creature: a headless body controlled by a detached head that still thinks and speaks, and which can outlive said body's destruction. It's not uncommon for would-be dragonslayers to be sent home carrying their own heads under one arm as a lesson in humility. The unluckier ones, alas, may be kept as trophies—and, in a very literal sense, conversation pieces—while the dragon devours their greater portion.

Many fill their lairs with coins, gems, and anything shiny they take from their victims, with some older hoards containing relics of the surrounding imperial nations. The condition of the items is of no importance to the vorvoraks; a hoard is just as likely to contain junk as items of true value.</p>\n<p>A fully grown vorvorak is around 24 feet long and weighs approximately 3,000 pounds, with muddy brown scales, a serpentine neck, and hard fins on their back that resemble wings.</p>",

These \"wall-coffined\" undead can manifest their forms within the structure where they were sealed, possessing the walls and stealthily traversing along them. Walcofindes' manifestations adopt the patterned appearance of the structure's materials, but not its physical properties. They take the form of hungry, grasping humanoid torsos emerging from the walls like harrowing extensions of their eternal prison. Unable to ever fully leave their structures, these undead are destined to be a part of it forever.</p>\n<p>Despite their decaying forms, walcofindes retain the intelligence they would've had in life; for example, a walcofinde who was previously a soldier could understand enemy tactics and assess the appearance and equipment of their foes, allowing them to strategize and prioritize targets as well as organize with other nearby walcofindes to formulate an attack.</p>",

Whether the wish is one of creation or destruction, justice or vengeance, love or hate, wish dragons seek to understand what makes it important to the wisher and view their ability to make it a reality as a gift that helps them make sense of the world.</p>\n<p>To a wish dragon, learning what someone wishes for is the beginning of a conversation, granting them that wish is a gift, and watching what they do with it is a reward. They take each part of this journey seriously and spend much of their lives moving among other ancestries to better understand what others want and need, especially during their younger years. While they view this mission as a righteous one, it can become all-consuming, and some have been known to lose all sense of themselves in their quest to bring about the dreams and desires of those around them.</p>",
