They have smooth, pale coats, hooves formed of bronze, and both the males and the females of the species bear antlers of pure gold. Iblydan hinds are known for their exceptional speed and agility as well as their intelligence, making them extraordinarily elusive in the wild.</p>\n<p>There's some debate as to the origins of the Iblydan hind. Some scholars believe the species came to the Universe from the First World through a long-ago planar breach, noting how the hinds' unusual characteristics are similar to the unpredictable evolutions of creatures from that plane. Others point to historical records that indicate the hind was purposefully bred by ancient druidic circles, though the purpose of their creation has been lost to time.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their pedigree, Iblydan hinds are a key symbol of Iblydan culture, often depicted in art and heraldry, with various superstitions surrounding them. A recurring element in hero-god stories is for an Iblydan hind to lead a hero-god to the correct path when they become lost, and it's said that a hunter who glimpses a hind in the forest is assured of a long life and good fortune. Due to the hinds' near-sacred status throughout Iblydos, slaying one is banned by all the city-states and punishable by exile, even death. In tribute to the hinds' fire breath, a common punishment for poachers is a trial by fire; if they survive the flames, they're allowed to live in exile.</p><h2>Chasing the Hind</h2><p>Chasing down and catching an Iblydan hind is a well-known rite of passage for Iblydan heroes and hero-gods, who often use this as a test of their speed and stamina. \"Hind catching\" is also a common game at festivals, with a dog or deer standing in for the hind, and golden antlers are a popular hair accessory at these events. Heroes aim to catch and release the hind without harming it; however, some who pursue Iblydan hinds do so with darker motivations, as the creatures' golden antlers fetch a high price on the black market.</p>",

As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw's oversized claws are powerful weapons with a viselike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey.</p>\n<p>Though reefclaws can't speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value—reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous—they've been known to tip over small fishing boats and attack those who fall overboard.</p>\n<p>Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after the brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then, the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring.</p>\n<p>Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet (for reefclaws raised in colder waters) or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most people who know of reefclaws' intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fishers whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures—or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.</p>",

      "description": "<p>With the proud bearing of a great raptor and the magnificence of a powerful horse, hippogriffs are thought to be an accidental fusion of creatures or perhaps the creation of a flesh-warping wizard with a keen aesthetic sense. Regardless of their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their favored plains or hill country.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs' superior speed helps protect them from these predators.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion.</p>\n<p>Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermied remains of deer, elk, and bears.</p>\n<p>However, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat—the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more difficult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount, fighting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement of their companion's wings.</p>",

A newly emergent people, sthenos have existed for just barely over a century. Only a few generations have passed since their genesis, and some adult sthenos remember members of the original generation. Indeed, since sthenos can live about as long as humans, a few of the original sthenos might yet live somewhere. As a people without a traditional homeland, sthenos seek to find societies that welcome them, which can be a challenging endeavor. With more than</p>\n<p>a passing resemblance to medusas, given their ophidian hair and striking features, they find most places are wary if not outright hostile to their presence.</p>\n<p>All sthenos descend from a single woman of the same name. Stheno rebelled against the poisoned gift of nightmares that the goddess Lamashtu granted her sisters, the powerful medusa matriarchs known as euryales. Stheno prayed to Shelyn, goddess of art and love, for help in overcoming her twisted birthright. Eventually, Lamashtu's power struck Stheno down, but Stheno's remaining faith and will imbued each of the hundred snakes from her hair with a mind and will of its own. Each snake grew into an individual stheno, and a new ancestry was born that day.</p>\n<p>Sthenos have been slowly spreading across the land, their numbers growing as they can have children with humans. In these families, children of all genders are born either fully human or fully stheno, seemingly at random. Sthenos with a welcoming community to call home tend toward large families with many children, perhaps from some survival instinct as early members of a new ancestry.</p>\n<p>Sthenos, unsurprisingly, have a great love for snakes, and they tend to keep other snakes as pets and companions to their hair. Stheno hair snakes are non-venomous and love to eat insects within their reach. They are semi-autonomous, though their behaviors are colored by the stheno's emotions.

A typical specimen resembles a bustard or peafowl with brown, red, and orange feathers. When it's excited, the feathers flicker with incandescence, and an irate pyrefowl can create sparks with a click of its beak or blow burning embers down at a foe with a wingbeat.</p>\n<p>Pyrefowl travel in small flocks for protection, and some hunt collectively by fanning out in a crescent and beating their wings. The resulting heat wave scatters insects and small mammals into the waiting beaks of other fowl. When threatened, a flock might turn this tactic against aggressors, even starting a brush fire to chase off intruders.</p>\n<p>Though they often roost in high places like rooftops in cities or on rocky bluffs and are certainly capable of flight, pyrefowl spend much of their time on the ground standing on their sturdy legs. Though these creatures are protected in some places, in others they're seen as a dangerous nuisance for their tendency to start or spread fires. In these locales, pyrefowl nests are hunted down, and the birds are either scattered or slain. Their beautiful feathers are sometimes harvested for artistic purposes, often decorating fancy clothing and adornments. Pyrefowl lay few eggs, far less than a typical chicken or duck, and in a few regions their eggs are seen as a delicacy and prized by elite cooks who feature them in baked egg dishes or incorporate them into baked goods. Most note the warm and smoky taste, with a slight hint of almond.</p><h2>Fortune and Fireproofing</h2><p>Thanks to their association with its patron phoenix, the city-state of Pol-Bailax extends legal protections to its resident pyrefowl. Harassing or killing the birds is prohibited, though licensed wardens are allowed to harvest naturally shed feathers. Pyrefowl roosting atop one's roof is said to bring good luck to a household, so the Bailaxians build roofs out of clay tiles, slate, or other fire-resistant materials to protect themselves while hoping to lure luck to their homes with small, built-in troughs of grains.</p>",

They eagerly follow the one who crafted them into battle and obey their creator's orders without question. One might expect them to be perfect soldiers, but they're prone to fighting among themselves if provoked. Typically, speiroikos last only as long as there's a battle to fight, disintegrating back into dirt once hostilities conclude. Some canny creators manage to prolong their existence by hurrying them from one battle to another.</p><h2>Wandering Speiroikos</h2><p>On rare occasions, a surviving member of a speiroikos troop will maintain its existence after battle, gaining full autonomy; this occurs more often in those created spontaneously. Such survivors often experience an existential crisis, having previously existed only to fight. Some wander the world seeking combat, while others attempt to blend in with humanoid societies and find new aspirations.</p>",

They're also a threat to travelers, especially those traversing the roads after dark. An encounter with a torcheater on a dark and winding road through the mountains can be deadly if they snuff the traveler's light. However, torcheaters can't stand being the subject of pranks in turn. If caught or taunted, a torcheater can quickly turn violent and attack their tormentor.</p>\n<p>In rare places of near-constant light where shadows don't fall, a torcheater can still exist in a sort of limbo where they're aware of their surroundings but unable manifest enough to affect the world around them. They can only hope for some shade to fall across them so they can then begin to restore their shadowy forms.</p><h2>Shadowy Witnesses</h2><p>A torcheater's first glimpse of the world is whatever crime created it.
