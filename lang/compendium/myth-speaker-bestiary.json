It helps prevent infection and inflammation, and many folk remedies make use of it. The honey of gigantic bees, being infused with mythic power, is an even more potent healing aid.

When they're too large to safely study an interesting set of more compact ruins, a cyclops seeker might hire on smaller adventurers as reconnaissance teams or research assistants, but woe to those who double-cross their scholarly employers, for while the cyclops seeker is a studious creature, they're also deadly in battle.</p><h2>Cyclopean Researchers</h2><p>It's not often a cyclops makes their way into Avistan, but those interested in learning for its own sake might seek out places of higher education to conduct obscure avenues of research for their own edification.

Folklore holds that, much like the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk's physiology lends any credence to this claim.</p>\n<p>A basilisk prefers to eat petrified flesh. Once a victim has been turned to stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow and inefficient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as if in mid-petrification itself. This has even led to the saying \"as slow as a well-fed basilisk.\" Certainly, basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed.</p>\n<p>An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turn to a guttural gurgle when they're agitated.</p>\n<p>Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these unusual congregations of basilisk activity is a mystery.</p>\n<p>For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other materials, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.</p>",

It's only at this point the spirits fade from Amneros and join the River of Souls as they head to Pharasma's judgment.</p>\n<p>Most of the shades in the underworld grimly accept this reality. They spend their days exploring the vast city, speaking with other shades who share their predicament, and eventually come to terms with the end of their mortal lives.</p>\n<p>Those few who lived exemplary lives are granted access to the Glades of Euphoria and experience something close to paradise. Others who spent their mortal days performing evil deeds find themselves suffering punishment in Bothrios until they can be released into the city of Amnaia. A few, however, are so filled with dread at the loss of their memories that they refuse to acquiesce to such a fate.</p>\n<p>These desperate shades spend much of their time in the Marshes of Memory, a quagmire of tangled echoes of the past that have been washed away by the moat surrounding Amnaia. Lurking in the marshes, the dead spirits frantically search for their own washed-away memories, but occasionally they attack newcomers to the underworld in hopes of stealing new memories to fill the holes in their own existence. Even if stolen memories are incongruent with their own lived experience, having something to recall is better than annihilation. These shades are dubbed \"forgotten dead\" by the other residents and are spoken of in guarded whispers.</p>\n<p>The forgotten dead often find themselves captured by the guardians employed in Amneros and sent to Bothrios as punishment. Nevertheless, there are tales of forgotten dead who've become so successful at stealing the memories of others that they stave off rejoining the River of Souls for hundreds, even thousands, of years.</p><h2>Merchants of Memories</h2><p>Rumors speak of forgotten dead who collect memories from the marshes and resell them to other shades in exchange for favors. Some powerful hero-gods or practitioners of magic able to travel to the underworld actively seek out such merchants in the hopes of uncovering long-lost magic or ancient secrets.

      "description": "<p>An unusual breed of cervid, Iblydan hinds are closer to the size of a bull or a moose than the average deer, often ten feet or more in height. They have smooth, pale coats, hooves formed of bronze, and both the males and the females of the species bear antlers of pure gold. Iblydan hinds are known for their exceptional speed and agility as well as their intelligence, making them extraordinarily elusive in the wild.</p>\n<p>There's some debate as to the origins of the Iblydan hind. Some scholars believe the species came to the Universe from the First World through a long-ago planar breach, noting how the hinds' unusual characteristics are similar to the unpredictable evolutions of creatures from that plane. Others point to historical records that indicate the hind was purposefully bred by ancient druidic circles, though the purpose of their creation has been lost to time.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their pedigree, Iblydan hinds are a key symbol of Iblydan culture, often depicted in art and heraldry, with various superstitions surrounding them. A recurring element in hero-god stories is for an Iblydan hind to lead a hero-god to the correct path when they become lost, and it's said that a hunter who glimpses a hind in the forest is assured of a long life and good fortune. Due to the hinds' near-sacred status throughout Iblydos, slaying one is banned by all the city-states and punishable by exile, even death. In tribute to the hinds' fire breath, a common punishment for poachers is a trial by fire; if they survive the flames, they're allowed to live in exile.</p><h2>Chasing the Hind</h2><p>Chasing down and catching an Iblydan hind is a well-known rite of passage for Iblydan heroes and hero-gods, who often use this as a test of their speed and stamina. \"Hind catching\" is also a common game at festivals, with a dog or deer standing in for the hind, and golden antlers are a popular hair accessory at these events. Heroes aim to catch and release the hind without harming it; however, some who pursue Iblydan hinds do so with darker motivations, as the creatures' golden antlers fetch a high price on the black market.</p>",

If they sense trouble, however, their true nature becomes much more obvious as their broad faces separate, revealing multiple heads filled with sharp teeth. Most keribos have three heads, but they can have up to five. The warning growl of a keribos is enough to send most shades running for shelter, and their baying draws the attention of any nearby stygian guardians.</p><hr /><p>Places in the afterlife are constantly under threat from those who seek the souls of the deceased for their own uses. Most realms in the Outer Sphere, however, have denizens who are tasked with guarding against such threat. Although psychopomps are best known for this task, even demons greedily protect the souls hoarded in the Outer Rifts. Other pockets of reality, such as Amneros, house great numbers of shades with fewer defenses aside from the ruler of the realm themself.</p><h2>Guardian Creation</h2><p>To protect the vulnerable shades of Amneros, Amnerion created specialized guardians adapted to the particular environment of their realm. These creatures, called stygian guardians, serve primarily as deterrent against unwelcome visitors, although they're sometimes tasked with capturing or redirecting wandering shades.</p><h2>Other Stygian Guardians</h2><p>While keribos and eumenids are the most frequently encountered stygian guardians, they're far from the only ones. Amnerion also created multi-armed giants called thalisons to carry out jobs requiring great strength and serve as protectors of their palace, although these giants spend most of their time melded into the cavern walls.

The island's more industrious inhabitants have created methods to tap into this power to heat their cities and water supply. Unfortunately, these public works require a level of maintenance not every city-state can afford or has the engineering acumen to perform successfully. In addition, several ancient city-state governments that employed such technology failed long ago, leaving behind sprawling networks of pipes and tunnels that either no longer function or are on the precipice of failure. When these systems fail, the result is often catastrophic to any living creatures in the area, not to mention to the overall infrastructure and civic property.</p>\n<p>To combat this, a group of engineer-minded hero-gods tried to develop mechanical creatures that could not only survive the tremendous heat in these networks but feed on it. They imagined deploying these constructs into damaged geothermal systems where they could repair the structures and be used again. They designed the constructs with serpentine bodies to easily move about the narrow pipes and tunnels. That the constructs could consume and be fueled by the dangerous debris they cleared was a bonus intended to maintain the network of tunnels so they didn't fall into disrepair.</p>\n<p>A few of these constructs operate as intended, but many rebelled against their creators, causing massive damage to any place where they were deployed. Dubbed lava spitters, these constructs now roam the pipes and tunnels beneath cities, their red-hot bellies scorching the ground wherever they crawl.</p><h2>Fire Giant Friends</h2><p>With their ability to crawl through small areas and an understanding of how to clean out blockages and slag, lava spitters have developed a symbiotic relationship with fire giants in their settlements. The giants appreciate the work the creatures do and have little fear of being harmed by them, while the lava spitters are happy to frolic in the giants' forges.

While good hygiene can help, these routines can be unfeasible for particularly massive entities who spend much of their lives inert, in hibernation, or far from an ideal mountain to itch against. Enter the strange and unsettling leviathan louse. These stone-hungry creatures resemble their smaller, more mundane cousins with bumpy, iridescent exoskeletons, but they're individually the size of a horse. Colonies of leviathan lice form symbiotic relationships with massive, rocky earth elementals, feeding on their rocky barnacles and (often literal) veins of minerals, in exchange for keeping their host clean.</p>\n<p>While they have little interest in feeding upon creatures closer to their own size, leviathan lice are quick to defend their territory, biting enemy combatants with massive mandibles or swiping with spiny forelegs. Rarely does a louse stray far from its host or find its way to planets like Golarion, but left to its own devices, it can reduce a rich mine to a crumbling, empty cavern in a matter of weeks.</p>\n<p>An adult leviathan louse is about 9 feet long and weighs between 1,500 and 2,100 pounds, though larger specimens raised on a plentiful, supernatural diet of strange ores or stone do exist. An adult lays eggs in crevices in the host's exterior. The larvae grow slowly, molting at least six times before reaching adulthood after several decades. These cast-off molts occasionally contain trace amounts of valuable metal that an industrious prospector might recover.</p><h2>Exterminating Lice</h2><p>As part of their invasion of the Plane of Metal, denizens of the Plane of Earth attempted to weaponize leviathan lice to simply eat the enemy's fortifications. This didn't endear them to the inhabitants of the Plane of Metal. Removed from their normal environments and deliberately starved, the leviathan lice devastated both architecture and local populations with their insatiable appetite for iron. Farmers, miners, and jewelers see little practical distinction between leviathan lice and their water-walking ore lice cousins, moving to eradicate any they see on sight.</p>",

As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw's oversized claws are powerful weapons with a viselike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey.</p>\n<p>Though reefclaws can't speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value—reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous—they've been known to tip over small fishing boats and attack those who fall overboard.</p>\n<p>Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after the brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then, the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring.</p>\n<p>Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet (for reefclaws raised in colder waters) or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most people who know of reefclaws' intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fishers whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures—or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.</p>",

They are typically nomadic and consider themselves the stewards of the surrounding landscapes. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid travelers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who seeks to plunder the natural resources of the areas in which their communities have lived, some of which have been home to centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite the tight bonds they form with their kin, some centaurs establish close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies often benefit by learning from the centaurs' extensive knowledge of herbalism and wilderness survival. While centaurs enjoying traveling, most find it difficult to cut ties with their families and leave their bands to seek adventure in the wider world.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper torsos share the same variation in skin tone as other humanoids of their region, but their lower bodies—like those of horses—can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an individual who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the clan to roam far from civilization to preserve some unspoiled terrain, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and rival centaur groups.</p>",

Regardless of their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their favored plains or hill country.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs' superior speed helps protect them from these predators.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion.</p>\n<p>Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermied remains of deer, elk, and bears.</p>\n<p>However, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat—the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more difficult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount, fighting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement of their companion's wings.</p>",

When they're not on alert, they're playful with the shades of the underworld and eager to be petted. If they sense trouble, however, their true nature becomes much more obvious as their broad faces separate, revealing multiple heads filled with sharp teeth. Most keribos have three heads, but they can have up to five. The warning growl of a keribos is enough to send most shades running for shelter, and their baying draws the attention of any nearby stygian guardians.</p><hr /><p>Places in the afterlife are constantly under threat from those who seek the souls of the deceased for their own uses. Most realms in the Outer Sphere, however, have denizens who are tasked with guarding against such threat. Although psychopomps are best known for this task, even demons greedily protect the souls hoarded in the Outer Rifts. Other pockets of reality, such as Amneros, house great numbers of shades with fewer defenses aside from the ruler of the realm themself.</p><h2>Guardian Creation</h2><p>To protect the vulnerable shades of Amneros, Amnerion created specialized guardians adapted to the particular environment of their realm. These creatures, called stygian guardians, serve primarily as deterrent against unwelcome visitors, although they're sometimes tasked with capturing or redirecting wandering shades.</p><h2>Other Stygian Guardians</h2><p>While keribos and eumenids are the most frequently encountered stygian guardians, they're far from the only ones. Amnerion also created multi-armed giants called thalisons to carry out jobs requiring great strength and serve as protectors of their palace, although these giants spend most of their time melded into the cavern walls. Within Bothrios, horrid half-mantis, half-scorpion creatures called scynoxthis mete out punishments to the wicked.</p>",

A newly emergent people, sthenos have existed for just barely over a century. Only a few generations have passed since their genesis, and some adult sthenos remember members of the original generation. Indeed, since sthenos can live about as long as humans, a few of the original sthenos might yet live somewhere. As a people without a traditional homeland, sthenos seek to find societies that welcome them, which can be a challenging endeavor. With more than</p>\n<p>a passing resemblance to medusas, given their ophidian hair and striking features, they find most places are wary if not outright hostile to their presence.</p>\n<p>All sthenos descend from a single woman of the same name. Stheno rebelled against the poisoned gift of nightmares that the goddess Lamashtu granted her sisters, the powerful medusa matriarchs known as euryales. Stheno prayed to Shelyn, goddess of art and love, for help in overcoming her twisted birthright. Eventually, Lamashtu's power struck Stheno down, but Stheno's remaining faith and will imbued each of the hundred snakes from her hair with a mind and will of its own. Each snake grew into an individual stheno, and a new ancestry was born that day.</p>\n<p>Sthenos have been slowly spreading across the land, their numbers growing as they can have children with humans. In these families, children of all genders are born either fully human or fully stheno, seemingly at random. Sthenos with a welcoming community to call home tend toward large families with many children, perhaps from some survival instinct as early members of a new ancestry.</p>\n<p>Sthenos, unsurprisingly, have a great love for snakes, and they tend to keep other snakes as pets and companions to their hair. Stheno hair snakes are non-venomous and love to eat insects within their reach. They are semi-autonomous, though their behaviors are colored by the stheno's emotions. An angry stheno might find their snakes lashing out at the subject of their wrath, while an amorous stheno's snakes might just want to snuggle instead.</p>",

A typical specimen resembles a bustard or peafowl with brown, red, and orange feathers. When it's excited, the feathers flicker with incandescence, and an irate pyrefowl can create sparks with a click of its beak or blow burning embers down at a foe with a wingbeat.</p>\n<p>Pyrefowl travel in small flocks for protection, and some hunt collectively by fanning out in a crescent and beating their wings. The resulting heat wave scatters insects and small mammals into the waiting beaks of other fowl. When threatened, a flock might turn this tactic against aggressors, even starting a brush fire to chase off intruders.</p>\n<p>Though they often roost in high places like rooftops in cities or on rocky bluffs and are certainly capable of flight, pyrefowl spend much of their time on the ground standing on their sturdy legs. Though these creatures are protected in some places, in others they're seen as a dangerous nuisance for their tendency to start or spread fires. In these locales, pyrefowl nests are hunted down, and the birds are either scattered or slain. Their beautiful feathers are sometimes harvested for artistic purposes, often decorating fancy clothing and adornments. Pyrefowl lay few eggs, far less than a typical chicken or duck, and in a few regions their eggs are seen as a delicacy and prized by elite cooks who feature them in baked egg dishes or incorporate them into baked goods. Most note the warm and smoky taste, with a slight hint of almond.</p><h2>Fortune and Fireproofing</h2><p>Thanks to their association with its patron phoenix, the city-state of Pol-Bailax extends legal protections to its resident pyrefowl. Harassing or killing the birds is prohibited, though licensed wardens are allowed to harvest naturally shed feathers. Pyrefowl roosting atop one's roof is said to bring good luck to a household, so the Bailaxians build roofs out of clay tiles, slate, or other fire-resistant materials to protect themselves while hoping to lure luck to their homes with small, built-in troughs of grains.</p>",

      "description": "<p>To a satyr, life is a party and everyone is invited. Notorious for their hedonism, these fey believe there's no greater beauty than can be found in song, drink, indulgent meals, and carnal pleasures. Satyrs use their enchanting songs and natural charm to encourage all manner of people to follow their true desires and free themselves from society's rules. This usually involves enticing mortals to join raucous parties or engage in trysts in moonlit glades. If a potential companion rejects a satyr's advances, however, the satyr has little interest in continuing a conversation and goes off to find more amenable revelers.</p>\n<p>The lifestyle of a satyr leaves no room for ongoing affairs or long-term friends. Once his party is over or his lust is satiated, the satyr disappears back into the forest. The offspring satyrs leave behind are satyrs themselves, and they usually end up being taken from their cradles by other fey rather than left in mortals' care. Satyrs are always male.</p>\n<p>The untouched beauty of the forest is sacred and precious to a satyr. Brutish intruders who clear-cut trees or massacre animals without eating them risk drawing a satyr's ire. A satyr so provoked uses his spells to undermine foes and attempts to dispatch them either with brutal ambushes or by leading a rush of forest animals to attack.</p>\n<p>Other fey, particularly more benevolent fey, look upon satyrs as loutish, embarrassing cousins. They're rarely hostile toward satyrs, but most find them insufferable and advise any mortals they like to steer clear of satyrs' glades.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Flame drakes dwell near volcanoes and magma, but it's not unheard of for one to drift into nearby areas like forests or wooded hills. Their scales are usually some shade of red, occasionally fading to smoky blacks and grays along the edges of their wings and the tips of their tails.</p>\n<p>Rampages of flame drakes often grudgingly live alongside clans of fire giants, rather than be forced from their volcanic homes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct, drakes are draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of the primal dragons they share evolutionary roots with. While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.</p>\n<p>Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thickscaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.</p>\n<p>Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them.</p>\n<h3>Drake Eggs</h3>\n<p>While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.</p>\n<p>A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.</p>\n<p>A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a @Check[nature|dc:20] check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.</p>\n<p>Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see. A creature imprinted on in this way can use Nature to Train and Command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the type of drake and the exact legal situation. Because drakes are dangerous and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.</p>\n<p>It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges.</p>",
