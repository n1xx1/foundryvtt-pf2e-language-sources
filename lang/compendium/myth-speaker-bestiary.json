It's only at this point the spirits fade from Amneros and join the River of Souls as they head to Pharasma's judgment.</p>\n<p>Most of the shades in the underworld grimly accept this reality. They spend their days exploring the vast city, speaking with other shades who share their predicament, and eventually come to terms with the end of their mortal lives.</p>\n<p>Those few who lived exemplary lives are granted access to the Glades of Euphoria and experience something close to paradise. Others who spent their mortal days performing evil deeds find themselves suffering punishment in Bothrios until they can be released into the city of Amnaia. A few, however, are so filled with dread at the loss of their memories that they refuse to acquiesce to such a fate.</p>\n<p>These desperate shades spend much of their time in the Marshes of Memory, a quagmire of tangled echoes of the past that have been washed away by the moat surrounding Amnaia. Lurking in the marshes, the dead spirits frantically search for their own washed-away memories, but occasionally they attack newcomers to the underworld in hopes of stealing new memories to fill the holes in their own existence. Even if stolen memories are incongruent with their own lived experience, having something to recall is better than annihilation. These shades are dubbed \"forgotten dead\" by the other residents and are spoken of in guarded whispers.</p>\n<p>The forgotten dead often find themselves captured by the guardians employed in Amneros and sent to Bothrios as punishment. Nevertheless, there are tales of forgotten dead who've become so successful at stealing the memories of others that they stave off rejoining the River of Souls for hundreds, even thousands, of years.</p><h2>Merchants of Memories</h2><p>Rumors speak of forgotten dead who collect memories from the marshes and resell them to other shades in exchange for favors. Some powerful hero-gods or practitioners of magic able to travel to the underworld actively seek out such merchants in the hopes of uncovering long-lost magic or ancient secrets.

They have smooth, pale coats, hooves formed of bronze, and both the males and the females of the species bear antlers of pure gold. Iblydan hinds are known for their exceptional speed and agility as well as their intelligence, making them extraordinarily elusive in the wild.</p>\n<p>There's some debate as to the origins of the Iblydan hind. Some scholars believe the species came to the Universe from the First World through a long-ago planar breach, noting how the hinds' unusual characteristics are similar to the unpredictable evolutions of creatures from that plane. Others point to historical records that indicate the hind was purposefully bred by ancient druidic circles, though the purpose of their creation has been lost to time.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their pedigree, Iblydan hinds are a key symbol of Iblydan culture, often depicted in art and heraldry, with various superstitions surrounding them. A recurring element in hero-god stories is for an Iblydan hind to lead a hero-god to the correct path when they become lost, and it's said that a hunter who glimpses a hind in the forest is assured of a long life and good fortune. Due to the hinds' near-sacred status throughout Iblydos, slaying one is banned by all the city-states and punishable by exile, even death. In tribute to the hinds' fire breath, a common punishment for poachers is a trial by fire; if they survive the flames, they're allowed to live in exile.</p><h2>Chasing the Hind</h2><p>Chasing down and catching an Iblydan hind is a well-known rite of passage for Iblydan heroes and hero-gods, who often use this as a test of their speed and stamina. \"Hind catching\" is also a common game at festivals, with a dog or deer standing in for the hind, and golden antlers are a popular hair accessory at these events. Heroes aim to catch and release the hind without harming it; however, some who pursue Iblydan hinds do so with darker motivations, as the creatures' golden antlers fetch a high price on the black market.</p>",

Other pockets of reality, such as Amneros, house great numbers of shades with fewer defenses aside from the ruler of the realm themself.</p><h2>Guardian Creation</h2><p>To protect the vulnerable shades of Amneros, Amnerion created specialized guardians adapted to the particular environment of their realm. These creatures, called stygian guardians, serve primarily as deterrent against unwelcome visitors, although they're sometimes tasked with capturing or redirecting wandering shades.</p><h2>Other Stygian Guardians</h2><p>While keribos and eumenids are the most frequently encountered stygian guardians, they're far from the only ones. Amnerion also created multi-armed giants called thalisons to carry out jobs requiring great strength and serve as protectors of their palace, although these giants spend most of their time melded into the cavern walls. Within Bothrios, horrid half-mantis, half-scorpion creatures called scynoxthis mete out punishments to the wicked.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The archipelago of Iblydos is quite geologically active, with sinkholes, volcanoes, and lava fissures pockmarking many of the islands. The island's more industrious inhabitants have created methods to tap into this power to heat their cities and water supply. Unfortunately, these public works require a level of maintenance not every city-state can afford or has the engineering acumen to perform successfully. In addition, several ancient city-state governments that employed such technology failed long ago, leaving behind sprawling networks of pipes and tunnels that either no longer function or are on the precipice of failure. When these systems fail, the result is often catastrophic to any living creatures in the area, not to mention to the overall infrastructure and civic property.</p>\n<p>To combat this, a group of engineer-minded hero-gods tried to develop mechanical creatures that could not only survive the tremendous heat in these networks but feed on it. They imagined deploying these constructs into damaged geothermal systems where they could repair the structures and be used again. They designed the constructs with serpentine bodies to easily move about the narrow pipes and tunnels. That the constructs could consume and be fueled by the dangerous debris they cleared was a bonus intended to maintain the network of tunnels so they didn't fall into disrepair.</p>\n<p>A few of these constructs operate as intended, but many rebelled against their creators, causing massive damage to any place where they were deployed. Dubbed lava spitters, these constructs now roam the pipes and tunnels beneath cities, their red-hot bellies scorching the ground wherever they crawl.</p><h2>Fire Giant Friends</h2><p>With their ability to crawl through small areas and an understanding of how to clean out blockages and slag, lava spitters have developed a symbiotic relationship with fire giants in their settlements. The giants appreciate the work the creatures do and have little fear of being harmed by them, while the lava spitters are happy to frolic in the giants' forges. Some fire giants even keep the little creatures as pets. It has become the height of fashion among fire giant royalty to have lava spitters curl around their fingers like rings.</p>",

As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw's oversized claws are powerful weapons with a viselike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey.</p>\n<p>Though reefclaws can't speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value—reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous—they've been known to tip over small fishing boats and attack those who fall overboard.</p>\n<p>Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after the brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then, the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring.</p>\n<p>Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet (for reefclaws raised in colder waters) or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most people who know of reefclaws' intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fishers whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures—or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.</p>",

Regardless of their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their favored plains or hill country.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs' superior speed helps protect them from these predators.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion.</p>\n<p>Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermied remains of deer, elk, and bears.</p>\n<p>However, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat—the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more difficult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount, fighting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement of their companion's wings.</p>",

These creatures, called stygian guardians, serve primarily as deterrent against unwelcome visitors, although they're sometimes tasked with capturing or redirecting wandering shades.</p><h2>Other Stygian Guardians</h2><p>While keribos and eumenids are the most frequently encountered stygian guardians, they're far from the only ones. Amnerion also created multi-armed giants called thalisons to carry out jobs requiring great strength and serve as protectors of their palace, although these giants spend most of their time melded into the cavern walls. Within Bothrios, horrid half-mantis, half-scorpion creatures called scynoxthis mete out punishments to the wicked.</p>",

A newly emergent people, sthenos have existed for just barely over a century. Only a few generations have passed since their genesis, and some adult sthenos remember members of the original generation. Indeed, since sthenos can live about as long as humans, a few of the original sthenos might yet live somewhere. As a people without a traditional homeland, sthenos seek to find societies that welcome them, which can be a challenging endeavor. With more than</p>\n<p>a passing resemblance to medusas, given their ophidian hair and striking features, they find most places are wary if not outright hostile to their presence.</p>\n<p>All sthenos descend from a single woman of the same name. Stheno rebelled against the poisoned gift of nightmares that the goddess Lamashtu granted her sisters, the powerful medusa matriarchs known as euryales. Stheno prayed to Shelyn, goddess of art and love, for help in overcoming her twisted birthright. Eventually, Lamashtu's power struck Stheno down, but Stheno's remaining faith and will imbued each of the hundred snakes from her hair with a mind and will of its own. Each snake grew into an individual stheno, and a new ancestry was born that day.</p>\n<p>Sthenos have been slowly spreading across the land, their numbers growing as they can have children with humans. In these families, children of all genders are born either fully human or fully stheno, seemingly at random. Sthenos with a welcoming community to call home tend toward large families with many children, perhaps from some survival instinct as early members of a new ancestry.</p>\n<p>Sthenos, unsurprisingly, have a great love for snakes, and they tend to keep other snakes as pets and companions to their hair. Stheno hair snakes are non-venomous and love to eat insects within their reach. They are semi-autonomous, though their behaviors are colored by the stheno's emotions. An angry stheno might find their snakes lashing out at the subject of their wrath, while an amorous stheno's snakes might just want to snuggle instead.</p>",

A typical specimen resembles a bustard or peafowl with brown, red, and orange feathers. When it's excited, the feathers flicker with incandescence, and an irate pyrefowl can create sparks with a click of its beak or blow burning embers down at a foe with a wingbeat.</p>\n<p>Pyrefowl travel in small flocks for protection, and some hunt collectively by fanning out in a crescent and beating their wings. The resulting heat wave scatters insects and small mammals into the waiting beaks of other fowl. When threatened, a flock might turn this tactic against aggressors, even starting a brush fire to chase off intruders.</p>\n<p>Though they often roost in high places like rooftops in cities or on rocky bluffs and are certainly capable of flight, pyrefowl spend much of their time on the ground standing on their sturdy legs. Though these creatures are protected in some places, in others they're seen as a dangerous nuisance for their tendency to start or spread fires. In these locales, pyrefowl nests are hunted down, and the birds are either scattered or slain. Their beautiful feathers are sometimes harvested for artistic purposes, often decorating fancy clothing and adornments. Pyrefowl lay few eggs, far less than a typical chicken or duck, and in a few regions their eggs are seen as a delicacy and prized by elite cooks who feature them in baked egg dishes or incorporate them into baked goods. Most note the warm and smoky taste, with a slight hint of almond.</p><h2>Fortune and Fireproofing</h2><p>Thanks to their association with its patron phoenix, the city-state of Pol-Bailax extends legal protections to its resident pyrefowl. Harassing or killing the birds is prohibited, though licensed wardens are allowed to harvest naturally shed feathers. Pyrefowl roosting atop one's roof is said to bring good luck to a household, so the Bailaxians build roofs out of clay tiles, slate, or other fire-resistant materials to protect themselves while hoping to lure luck to their homes with small, built-in troughs of grains.</p>",

Their scales are usually some shade of red, occasionally fading to smoky blacks and grays along the edges of their wings and the tips of their tails.</p>\n<p>Rampages of flame drakes often grudgingly live alongside clans of fire giants, rather than be forced from their volcanic homes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct, drakes are draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of the primal dragons they share evolutionary roots with. While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.</p>\n<p>Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them with their formidable jaws and thickscaled tails to use in close combat. Most drakes would rather avoid this, however, preferring to use their magical breath to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.</p>\n<p>Different species of drakes rarely come into conflict. Part of this is their distinct habitats, but drakes are open to negotiating simple agreements between rampages. This courtesy does not extend to dragonets, which drakes happily take as prey. Solitary tamed drakes are also excluded from such agreements and considered free game if their tamer isn't strong enough to protect them.</p>\n<h3>Drake Eggs</h3>\n<p>While drake hides aren't any more valuable than those of similarly sized creatures, drake eggs are prized commodities. They are used as components in powerful spells as well as eaten by various cultures, but the most common use for drake eggs is hatching and rearing drakes to serve as mounts and guardians.</p>\n<p>A typical drake lays a clutch of 2d4 eggs every 5 years. Eggs hatch within 3 to 6 weeks, during which time they must be kept in conditions appropriate to their natural environment, perhaps the most difficult aspect of drake husbandry. While it is generally easy for breeders to incubate the eggs of desert or jungle drakes (which require mildly warm temperatures to hatch) or river drakes (which must be submerged in running water), the eggs of flame and frost drakes require extreme temperatures in order to hatch, which can be difficult to replicate safely.</p>\n<p>A drake egg is an object with Hardness 3, 5 HP, and no Broken Threshold. The coloration of drake eggs varies only slightly from one species to the next. A creature must succeed at a @Check[nature|dc:20] check, or a relevant DC 20 Lore check, to identify the drake species of a specific egg.</p>\n<p>Once a drake hatches, they imprint on the first creature that they see. A creature imprinted on in this way can use Nature to Train and Command that drake. The market price of a drake egg varies depending on the type of drake and the exact legal situation. Because drakes are dangerous and intelligent creatures, many societies do not condone the trade of drake eggs and criminalize those who engage in it.</p>\n<p>It takes 2 years for a drake hatchling to grow to full size. A well-trained drake can make a fearsome mount or guardian, but many careless would-be drake trainers are devoured by their charges.</p>",

By all appearances, the sextant shouldn't function, as the shades and mirrors are swapped, but when you look through the spyglass, you see a night sky during the day and the sun during the night, as if day and night were inverted.</p>\n<p>When you use the sextant, you gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks, which increases to a +2 item bonus when you Sense Direction.</p>"
