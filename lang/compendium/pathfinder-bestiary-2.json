Aapophs often have unusual physical mutations-horns, vestigial tails, or spines protruding from their scales-yet these variations have little impact on their overall combat prowess- and combat prowess is the measure by which zyss judge them.</p>",

Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.</p>\n<p>For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.</p>",

This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.</p>\n<p>For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.</p>",

The ahuizotl's macabre habit of feeding on a victim's eyes, fingernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual flesh of its victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely possibility-the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair.</p>\n<p>An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature's vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although they don't form societies of their own, they have been known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.</p>",

      "description": "<p>An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

Ankous never speak aloud; when they feel the need to communicate at all, they do so in a telepathic whisper directly into a victim's mind. While an ankou's body is made of strange, fleshy material, their claws and the cruel hooks on their wings are made of razor-sharp cold iron, a quality that makes them much feared among other fey. A typical ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan but weighs less than 80 pounds.</p>\n<p>While most ankous serve powerful masters, some of these murderous fey are left to their own devices and serve none but their own capricious, cruel whims. In some cases, their master may have been slain, while in others the ankou may have been released from service for any number of reasons. An ankou left to indulge their own whims unrestrained is often the most dangerous ankou of them all!</p>",

Rather than consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.</p>\n<p>As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can't be trained in the classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.</p>\n<p>Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump, blood-red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Inhabitants of damp, subterranean caves, blindheims resemble stubby humanoids with oversized, frog-like heads and bulbous eyes. Their eyes emit a soft glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.</p>\n<p>Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.</p>\n<p>It's not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars use them as \"raid frogs,\" placing heavy hoods over blindheims' heads and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.</p>",

      "description": "<p>At first glance, blink dogs seem to be little more than long-eared, bearded canines with tawny coats. Yet their intelligent eyes and the blue nimbus of energy that dances across their fur hint at not only the blink dog's inherent intelligence, but also of their connection to the occult energies and mysteries that hide beyond the sight of the untrained eye. These honorable creatures are as intelligent as most humanoids. They live and hunt in large packs, roaming forests, plains, and the hidden places of the world in hunt for evil creatures-particularly those that dwell in the depths of the Ethereal Plane.</p>\n<p>Unless acting in concert with specific allies who have proven that their goals are shared, blink dogs tend to avoid other creatures if at all possible. Their packs are constantly on the move and hidden from those that would seek them out. But in times of need, they have been known to come to the rescue of villages and lost travelers. While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog, this constant state of flux is as natural as breathing.</p>\n<p>Pack leadership always falls to a pair-an elder blink dog (called an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of blink dog society. They are fiercely loyal, defending the pack or creatures they befriend to the death and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Though different packs hold different traditions and oaths, their connection through the tales and stories told among their kind and the shared experience of the movement of stars above weave all blink dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars, and read omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. These celestial signs are woven into blink dogs' lifeways; their names contain a reference to the specific constellation under which they were born, and a pack's sage watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is old enough for their first hunt.</p>",

Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally-certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar.

Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.</p>",

The strange little aberrations prefer to pick off weak and solitary creatures, especially those that wander off from their packs or communities. A choker's long, spongy arms are flexible but deceptively strong. The fingers can tighten rapidly and are ridged with spiky, tooth-like structures that provide an incredible grip. A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn't very deep-it just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.</p>\n<p>Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned structures. These chokers stalk at night, flopping across rooftops, tapping at windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An urban choker that finds prey early on its hunt-a wandering pet, a person who is out alone-might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items, from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to find a larger nest to accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.</p>",

Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.</p>\n<p>A typical chupacabra measures nearly 5-1/2 feet from its muzzle to the tip of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 4 feet tall. With their slight build and lightweight bones, most weigh close to 100 pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother typically leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.</p>\n<p>Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs.

Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict sadistic suffering.

Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.</p>",

      "description": "<p>These massive, primeval relatives of ordinary slugs squirm slowly through swamps and grasslands. Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat flesh or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they first shred the creatures using their radula-tongue-like appendages covered in teeth- to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated, and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.</p>\n<p>Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides of bridges, or even fortifications like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break. Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but instead finds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant slugs don't have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable, so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like kobolds or xulgaths.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Though they may resemble constructs to the untrained eye due to their metallic, interlocking armor plates that look and feel like polished stone, gorgons are a creature of flesh and bone. These ill-tempered beasts greet interlopers with a charge or trample accompanied with belches of petrifying breath. Gorgons are dangerous on their own, and when they band together in herds, they become especially deadly.</p>\n<p>Gorgons typically subsist on petrified flesh or fossils. These supernatural beasts can gain sustenance from natural stone if they must, though they find raw stone flavorless, so it's not a preferred food source. In battle, gorgons use their petrifying breath to turn their prey into stone. They break up the resulting statues with their hooves or horns and swallow the stony chunks with loud chewing bites. Gorgons cannot digest unpetrified organic material, and if they try, they experience sickness and great gastrointestinal peril. Such discomforts are not life threatening to gorgons, but they do make the creatures even more ill tempered than usual-much to the chagrin of anyone they subsequently encounter.</p>\n<p>Gorgon flesh tastes vaguely like beef, but with a gritty, earthy texture and aftertaste that most meat connoisseurs find off-putting. Creatures with a close association to earth and stone are more likely to find the flavor appetizing; stone giants in particular consider gorgon steaks to be delicacies. Some cultures, notably dwarven cultures, consider the preparation of gorgon for meals as both a physical and a culinary challenge. Chefs who work with gorgon flesh can find renown for their skill in creating palatable dishes from such naturally unpalatable meat.</p>",

Though they prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within.</p>\n<p>Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these \"pets\" poorly at best.</p>\n<p>There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey-for the most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company worth keeping.</p>\n<p>Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers won't stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it's just part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.</p>",

Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging from a few individuals to a few hundred. Smaller schools can sometimes be brought under the leadership of a powerful aquatic creature, though such alliances last only until the school faces a major setback, at which point the surviving grindylows scatter and form smaller schools of their own.</p>\n<p>Grindylows aren't territorial, but they are pragmatic; while they rarely build permanent structures, they will adopt a good hunting ground for generations until driven away by predators. They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship.

While this can keep smaller schools at bay, it can also backfire, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship's route becomes predictable.

These frog-like humanoids are uniquely adapted to their environment, with oversized eyes that give them keen vision in both light and dark and large toes that allow them to easily scale trees. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, with their physiologies influenced by their surrounding environment. Those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled-brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds.</p>\n<p>Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't maintain typical farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.</p>\n<p>Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk. They make use of broad leaves and thick branches to further obscure their villages, making them especially difficult to spot from the forest floor, and riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they can navigate.</p>\n<p>Grippli scouts typically keep watch on the outskirts of grippli settlements. More potent gripplis inhabit the settlements, be they religious leaders, powerful druids, or agile warriors that, due to their small size, focus more on finesse weapons and ranged attacks than on melee tactics.</p>",

Long exposure to this corruption can cause vile transformations and hideous mutations, and entire miserable communities of corrupted creatures sometimes rise in swamplands where a hezrou dwells. Hezrous themselves prefer simple pleasures, and they often waste their considerable intellect in the pursuit of comfortable places to slumber, squealing meals to eat, or objects of beauty to deface. They do not seek out cults to fawn over them but will not turn away those who seek to worship on their own. Hezrous form from the souls of those who abused and polluted their environs or neighbors, either through the introduction of toxins to the region or the insidious spread of drugs and poisons through a society.</p>",

Regardless of their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their favored plains or hill country.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs' superior speed helps protect them from these predators.</p>\n<p>Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion.</p>\n<p>Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermic remains of deer, elk, and bears.</p>\n<p>However, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat- the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more difficult. Hippogriff riders must use special saddles and combat techniques that allow them to act in concert with their mount, fighting effectively while avoiding interfering with the movement of their companion's wings.</p>",

Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict sadistic suffering.

The process of transformation warps the soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Shadow Plane.</p>",

The jabberwock hails from the fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures known collectively as the Tane.</p>\n<p>Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat, drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a single mortal. Sometimes, no specific insult or injury is required, as some of the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its younger and less chaotic sibling.</p>\n<p>Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its first order of business is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day's flight from civilization-the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might eventually come hunting it, the better!</p>\n<p>The relationship between jabberwocks and vorpal weapons is the subject of much debate and speculation among scholars, and the various poems, songs, and legends about the jabberwock do little to clarify the issue, conflicting and diverging on this point. Some believe that vorpal weapons were first created specifically to combat jabberwocks, but others take the story one step further. They cite evidence in certain ancient myths that there may once have been only a single, unique jabberwock, so powerful that nothing could so much as scratch it-nothing, that is, except for the first vorpal sword, crafted for that very purpose. So epic was the resulting battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of vorpal weapons, can now be found on many worlds. Those who subscribe to this belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock, and they speculate that only the combined efforts of several Eldest would be sufficient to create such a creature again.</p>\n<p>Variant JabberwocksThe Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.</p>\n<p>Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level 24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a jaws Strike.</p>\n<p>Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World, mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of fire, and have eyes that burn with blue flames that deal cold damage instead of fire damage.</p>\n<p>Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the normal fly Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock's whiffling aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.</p>",

Rather, they engage in conversation and try to charm, cajole, or trick those they meet into doing favors for them or freely giving over a treasured item, usually in return for illusory wealth or false promises of wealth and success. These small tricksters are masters at discerning the desires of those they meet-a knack that puts them in a powerful position when bargaining for goods or favors. They aren't above turning people against each other for their own benefit but generally not to an extent that causes harm.</p>\n<p>In most cases, a leprechaun doesn't keep a purloined possession for long. The leprechaun most often returns such stolen prizes just in time to defuse tensions, often as they point out the humor of the situation, hoping to share their amusement and mirth with the victim. In cases where a leprechaun's trick goes too far and results in an incensed victim, the leprechaun quickly flees the conflict rather than engage in combat. This willingness to return stolen goods or to flee from battles fades as leprechauns grow older. Ancient leprechauns who have lived for thousands of years often spiral into dark bitterness and increasingly use their powers and illusions to lure those who offend them or fail to appreciate a joke into danger... or even death.</p>",

A nereid must be careful when manifesting a shawl, however, as their life essence is bound to it, so it can be stolen or destroyed to threaten the nereid.</p>\n<p>Nereids prefer to exist in isolation. Left to their own devices, they avoid combat, but when forced to fight, their ability to transform the natural waters in their flesh into poison serves them as well as any weapon.</p>\n<p>Often, ignorant sailors lump all water-dwelling fey into a single category of \"aquatic tempters\", regardless of the fey's type or gender, using these creatures' names interchangeably to represent the concept of a beautiful figure who exists to lure mortals to a drowning death. Whereas naiads have more patience and often seek to educate the ignorant regarding the harm that stereotypes can cause, nereids and rusalkas have little patience for such methods. Rusalkas are the primary source for the legends of fey preying upon sailors, and nereids loathe them for that, as they prefer to live apart from humanity and enjoy the beauty of the natural world in peace.</p>\n<p>When a nereid learns of a rusalka's increased activity, it often seeks out the rusalka to route them-not so much out of an urge to protect humanoids (in whom nereids traditionally have little interest), but to prevent the rusalka from inadvertently riling up violent responses from humanoids who can't be bothered to note the difference between a murderous fey and one who just wants to be left alone.</p>",

Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids, hoping trespassers won't give them cause to act. Stories of minor miracles granted by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon. On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more significant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home.</p>\n<p>Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, when they can establish magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers. Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are given invitations to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.</p>\n<p>Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes, catfish-like whiskers, and webbed fingers and toes. They have scaly skin, pointed ears, and long hair the color of seaweed. Nixies often form small communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great enough. In many cultures' folklore, there are stories of nixie nations hidden at the bottom of particularly large lakes.</p>",

They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon-or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings.</p>\n<p>Norns' relationship with the Eldest of the First World is complex. Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire.</p>\n<p>While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken. These norns, for their part, use their perceived neutrality judiciously. They know better than to issue too many demands to the Eldest, lest the capricious demigods grow frustrated and tired of norns' interference. And so the balance of power remains tenuous between unaffiliated norns and the Eldest, as it has for eons. However, norns know that it's merely a matter of time before the Eldest lose their respect for this tradition and start acting entirely as they please, despite norns' best efforts to rein in their most disruptive actions.</p>\n<p>A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.</p>\n<p>Worshipping Norns On the Material Plane, some mortals worship norns as deities, while others, especially witches and bards, admire them as patrons or muses. Those who uphold norns as deities are known as Followers of Fate. Norns do little to discourage this veneration, but neither do they go out of their way to support such worship. Clerics who venerate norns might worship a specific norn or norn triumvirate, or all norns as a whole, but they gain the same benefits regardless of their choice. The religious symbol of Followers of Fate is a pair of shears cutting a golden thread, and their areas of concern are destiny, fate, and the aging process.</p>",

Once food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.</p>\n<p>Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have dark-brown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees' disturbing mouths remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on the trunk.

The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby creatures in the mistaken notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home.

These sites allow them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence.

Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent end long before then.

Local scholars still debate whether the cause of the influx was the sudden change in weather or if the creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.</p>\n<p>When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed, they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales' natural camouflage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching poisonous vapor into an opponent's face.

Regardless, tendriculoses have little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great patience and plentiful food-and these the gifts of food must be alive when handed over.</p>\n<p>When it has finished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach.

Their amphibious nature shows in the webbing between the digits of their feet and hands, as well as the fact that they have both gills and a human-shaped nose and mouth. Triton hair grows in wide strands like seagrass, commonly green in shade but in some cases blue or white. Their eyes range in color from sea blue to golden.</p>\n<p>Many tritons see themselves as defenders of the deep, dedicating their lives to protecting the inhabitants of the seas from evil creatures and intruders-whether they come from underwater or the surface world. Primary among triton foes are sea devils and alghollthu, both of whom have amphibious forces that tritons have had to fight underwater and on land.</p>\n<p>In their quest to fight underwater evil, tritons sometimes ally with dolphins and sea turtles (both of which make excellent mounts), water elemental, and sometimes even sharks and sea serpents. Tritons can summon such allies using a conch shell as a trumpet. When it comes to other intelligent undersea species, however, tritons take pride in their self-sufficiency, rarely trading with other underwater peoples such as merfolk, and even more rarely forming established alliances.</p>\n<p>Tritons live in natural-grown villages on the sea floor, forging dwellings out of colorful coral reefs, in rift valleys heated by volcanic activity, and even in underwater canyons- though they avoid settling in extreme depths due to the risk of encountering krakens or worse.

Requiring vast quantities of meat to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell, their voracious hunger driving them to slaughter and consume any prey they encounter. In some regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds' keen sense of smell to aid in the hunt.</p>\n<p>Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating contagion known as bloodfire fever. Creatures that contract the disease through the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than suffering from skin irritation, both trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease.</p>\n<p>Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts don't recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative powers are potent indeed.</p>\n<p>While trolls themselves have had great success in domesticating, training, and even befriending trollhounds, the same cannot be said for other would-be masters. Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds' diseased slobber, their ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping into the hinterlands. Left to their own devices, a pack of escaped trollhounds can breed relatively quickly, and it can take less than a year for a small pack to multiply into a significant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds to the trolls, as they say!</p>",

A twigjack's body is made up of prickly brambles woven with vines. Shaggy, mossy growth, not unlike hair, tops a twigjack's head. Its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature's body. Many dense forests on Golarion have at least a handful of twigjacks living in the undergrowth.</p>\n<p>While truculent and violent, twigjacks care deeply for what they consider to be their forests. These creatures harass outsiders who delve deep into their wooded domains, forcing back even the most determined explorers, foresters, and travelers, especially when those intruders cut roads through the forest. However, they are not terribly territorial when it comes to other forest creatures. When sylvan creatures, especially fey, rally against an outside threat, twigjacks in the area eagerly arrive to fight, even if they were not invited.</p>\n<p>Less seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often mistake them for leshys, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they have a low opinion of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks resent being considered mere animated plants at all. Rather, they embrace their fey heritage-often to a foolish end. Twigjacks go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures they live among. Several popular comic songs weave the tale of a twigjack attempting to woo a powerful and graceful dryad, only to be comically disgraced after many loutish attempts. Many fey seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but some spriggans, quicklings, and redcaps harness the twigjacks' violent urges and disruptive behavior for their own purposes.</p>\n<p>While twigjacks are fey, and as such are often found in the First World, it's somewhat curious that those twigjacks who find religion only rarely turn to the Eldest of the First World. Instead, twigjacks tend to worship false deities of their own design: figures spotted in tangles of tree branches, clots of undergrowth, or other hidden nooks in the natural world. These religions are always highly localized, and while these faiths do not support clerics, they often inspire zealous crusades against non-fey.</p>",

They sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey-a pursuit they approach with great creativity. The mists' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead.

This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims.</p>\n<p>A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal.</p>\n<p>The name \"void zombie\" is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included \"void dead,\" \"akata spawn,\" or \"bloodwalker,\" but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two- after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of this strange behavior.</p>",

Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.</p>\n<p>Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm sightings usually occur when they can't help but to rise up to the surface to take a peek at someone particularly unusual on the beach or floating on the water's surface.</p>\n<p>These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folk tales that caution residents against venturing out alone near the water.</p>\n<p>While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.</p>",

Despite their size, they are graceful and agile, able to move through dense forests and brush with little sound. They have been known to work closely with druids and others who share their respect for the sanctity of wilderness regions. Wood giants spend their days patrolling vast swaths of territory, foraging, and keeping an eye out for any who would despoil their lands. While they respect the connection to nature they share with many fey creatures and remain on good terms with them, wood giants see most fey as far too flighty to take part in any long-term plans.</p>\n<p>An average wood giant stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.</p>",

It's less common for wood golems to have artistic embellishments such as engraved patterns, or to be carved in the shapes of different types of creatures to meet the tastes of their owners. While wealthy patrons have been known to commission wood golems to be painstakingly carved to resemble themselves or their ancestors, to serve dual purposes of protection and ego bolstering, most wood golem crafters don't bother. Druids and creatures who protect woodlands, such as arboreals, typically see wood golems as an affront or an abomination, akin to the horror humanoids often feel when facing a carrion or flesh golem. As a result, it is rare to see such creatures serving as guardians for fey or druidic holy sites, despite the thematic match between the wood golem's appearance and such locations.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The shape and structure of a golem are limited only by the power and creativity of its crafter.

Their eerie bays echo across the countryside when they are engaged in a hunt, and they particularly enjoy baying to frighten and disorient intelligent creatures. Yeth hound packs can number as many as a dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from the hounds' previous meals.</p>\n<p>Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight, working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when then can't simply overpower and kill them.</p>\n<p>Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound servants by fiendish patrons.

Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.</p>\n<p>A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw-they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.</p>\n<p>Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items-they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively.

      "description": "<p>At heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.</p>\n<p>A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw-they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.</p>\n<p>Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items-they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively. To a cloud dragon, a diversified hoard is a perfect hoard.</p>",

These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.</p>\n<p>For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.</p>",

Their sleek black scales and serpentine grace allow them to strike from hiding, and they are known for playing with their prey before finally finishing it. These creatures of shadowy energy and unwholesome appetites prefer the necrotic flesh of undead creatures to any other meal. This strange hunger can be of accidental benefit to nearby humanoid societies, but ultimately they hunt and kill undead creatures for the taste, rather than out of any desire to protect others from the undead. The benefit is always short-lived, however. When umbral dragons exhaust their preferred prey, they turn on whatever living creatures happen to be nearby. Umbral dragons sometimes go to great lengths to obtain their favorite meals, even creating undead creatures that they then feast upon.</p>\n<p>For all their power, umbral dragons are uninterested in fair battles. When faced with foes that pose any kind of actual danger to them, umbral dragons flee into the shadows and seek to strike back through pawns or minions rather than risk their own lives. Their treasure hoards are varied and diverse, often augmented by loot stolen from crypts the dragons have turned into feeding grounds. They have a strong respect for and interest in traditions and heirlooms, and they often seek to augment their hoards with items of great value that have been handed down through the generations of those whose corpses and ghosts they've fed upon.</p>",
