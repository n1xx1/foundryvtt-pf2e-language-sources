      "description": "<p>Gambling devils, known also as agadazes, resemble horned humans crafted out of living gold in their natural forms, though their shapeshifting abilities let them move among mortals undetected. They're most commonly encountered in Erebus, the third layer of Hell, where many serve Mammon as accountants. They're unusually impulsive and distractible for their kind. Other devils often view their Risk Aura as a hindrance, so they usually receive less important missions. They don't mind, for it gives them more time to meddle with mortals.</p><h2>Heavy Footsteps</h2><p>Even when appearing in a humanoid guise, a gambling devil's body remains extremely dense and heavy, often weighing more than 500 pounds. Old gamblers' yarns warn to watch the footsteps of fellow gamblers and be wary of those whose tread seems disproportionate to their size, though in truth, all but the most careless gambling devils know how to step lightly in their humanoid forms.</p>",

They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.</p>\n<p>Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.</p>\n<p>Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures.

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

In this form, a kishi's powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim's bones in a matter of moments.</p>\n<p>Kishi range widely in their physical features, and their height and weight vary as much as the people whose communities they infiltrate. They dress in fine clothing aligned with the latest fashion trends, and they wear flashy jewelry with the intention of drawing onlookers' eyes.</p>\n<p>Like most fey, a kishi has inscrutable motives, though to their victims, the kishi's goal seems simple-to revel in the expression of shock, betrayal, and terror on a victim's face. Although kishis can cast charm to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. These ultimate sadists derive pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better-for nothing satisfies kishis as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it.</p>\n<p>When kishis get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their victim. Kishis have no desire to share their true nature with the entire community, so they typically aim for the throats of their victims, who can no longer cry out for help after being cut off from air. Kishis consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime-even lapping up any spilled blood, claiming the victim's treasures as their own, and cleaning the murder scene as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Few things can bind a community together as swiftly as uncovering a kishi. Once found out, a kishi flees, hoping to find a new community to prey upon.</p>",

It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity-hence its name-before lapping up the tasty insides.</p>\n<p>Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication. While the adorable beasts can never be fully tamed due to their hyper-evolved hunting instincts, they can be bribed with food and, if kept satiated, displayed on a perch or indoor terrarium as an example of their master's cunning and deadliness. As often as not, these pseudo-domesticated skull peelers end up devouring a guest, pet, or their would-be owner, but this possibility doesn't stop up-and-coming crime lords from attempting to domesticate the little predators. Skull peelers kept in well-managed zoos fare somewhat better, but these clever creatures don't always stay in their cages, which has led to wild skull peelers in places travelers might not expect.</p>",

A specific rezzelki's favorite food is always a specific type of creature—some even prefer to dine exclusively on the dry bodies of undead like mummies—but most have a taste for a singular humanoid ancestry. Presented with a potential meal, the rezzelki moves quickly to smash its feast with its wide tail.

The death—especially a traumatic death—of a sapient creature in close proximity to a wax figure or while attempting to craft a construct out of wax might also result in a waxen effigy.</p>\n<p>A waxen effigy looks like a partially melted wax version of who it appeared as in life. They retain little of their former personality but recall a jumble of memories from their mortal existence that serves only to anger them. They often cling to objects that were important to them in life, such as a spouse's wedding band or a tool from a favorite hobby. Displaying such an object to a waxen effigy transfixes their attention, though they often lash out if the object is taken away before they can be laid to rest.</p><h2>Cruel Creations</h2><p>Few set out to create a waxen effigy on purpose, as their fragmented memories cause them to behave rather erratically, and as such, they make poor guardians or assassins.
