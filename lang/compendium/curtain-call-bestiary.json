They're most commonly encountered in Erebus, the third layer of Hell, where many serve Mammon as accountants. They're unusually impulsive and distractible for their kind. Other devils often view their Risk Aura as a hindrance, so they usually receive less important missions. They don't mind, for it gives them more time to meddle with mortals.</p><h2>Heavy Footsteps</h2><p>Even when appearing in a humanoid guise, a gambling devil's body remains extremely dense and heavy, often weighing more than 500 pounds. Old gamblers' yarns warn to watch the footsteps of fellow gamblers and be wary of those whose tread seems disproportionate to their size, though in truth, all but the most careless gambling devils know how to step lightly in their humanoid forms.</p>",

In this way, they act as preservers of holy practices that have otherwise been forgotten beneath the desert's shifting sands.</p>\n<p>Though girtablilus are used to explorers seeking entrance to the sites they defend, they might welcome those who earnestly wish to learn or offer reverence. A few even proudly share their beliefs with others, eager for the opportunity to preach to someone new. But girtablilus show no mercy to those who attempt to desecrate the sites and objects of their worship, or to those who would violate the tenets of their faith.</p>\n<p>Girtablilus are skilled fighters who keep trained giant scorpions as pets, and they remain unmatched when it comes to fighting in the desert. They require relatively little food or water, and they rely on their stamina to outlast their enemies. When necessary, they can stalk their quarry for days or even weeks, coordinating with their pets to drive their prey in circles. Once exhausted, few foes can stand up to a girtablilu's physical prowess-or their deadly venom.</p>",

One that dies by violence does not perpetuate its kind, presenting a vexing question to sages: where do these creatures come from, and why haven't they gone extinct over the ages?</p><h2>Cultist Creations</h2><p>The answer to \"where are furnericos from?\" is known by only a few, for it lies with the faithful of the parasite god Ghlaunder. These cultists use obscure rites to create furnericos from the very filth the monsters wallow in. Ghlaunder worshippers often do so to create powerful guardians for their hidden temples; furnericos created in this manner instinctively treat worshippers of Ghlaunder as allies... a trait not shared by those born from a prior furnerico, and a lesson many Ghlaunder cultists only learn moments before their death after assuming otherwise from a furnerico found in the wild.</p>",

Smaller peoples know that desert giants are the undisputed masters of desert living, and ignorant humans often claim that it is a desert giant's unique physiology, like a camel, that enables them to survive without water for 2 weeks. The few desert giants who mingle in the societies of smaller humanoids don't bother to dispute such ridiculous rumors.</p>\n<p>In fact, desert giants' strong cultural traditions play a large part in their ability to prosper in such harsh environs. Desert giant elders encourage their descendants to maintain abstemious lifestyles, particularly with regard to the consumption of food and drink. Alcohol is particularly disdained by desert giants, who view mind-altering diuretics like liquor and ale as dangerous temptations in an environment as unforgiving as the desert. Instead, most desert giants follow a simple vegetarian diet and maintain an incredible internal map of their home region's seasonal waterways and oases.</p>\n<p>Their austere habits and intolerance for foolishness have earned desert giants a reputation as being ill-humored and no-nonsense, but many of their communities boast a wide variety of humorous tales in their vast oral histories and legends. Since desert giants' journeys across the wastes can span weeks or even months at a time, an individual who can make their companions laugh with a witty joke or amusing parable remains a prized member of the community.</p>\n<p>Desert giants stand 15 feet tall, tending toward lean physiques that are ideal for traveling across vast expanses of sand for long sojourns.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Many kinds of giants lurk in the inhospitable corners of the world, making their homes in unlikely locales ranging from fetid sinkholes and ruined battlefields to mass graveyards and barren badlands.</p>",

They care little for either good or evil. As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin.</p>\n<p>Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.</p>\n<p>Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures. Brine dragon hoards often consist of a mix of offerings and taxes paid by those they rule over and strange discoveries salvaged from sunken ships.</p>",

They are incarnations of all the malice people try to deny within themselves and instead wrongly ascribe to deadly predators of the wild. Their power and skill inspire fear, but also awe, and it is not unknown for some peoples to treat such a rakshasa as a guardian, if one to be treated with extreme caution.</p>\n<p>Despite their nature as brutal flesh-eaters, rajas are extremely eloquent and philosophical when they choose to be. This is simply another form of camouflage, one that allows them to blend into cities, much as their stripes allow them to fade into jungles, and it often lulls scholars and intellectuals into a false sense of security. While it is not in the nature of a raja-krodha to be a social schemer or a mastermind, it pleases them when others delude themselves into thinking they are.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rakshasas are primordial, divine beings who serve as incarnations of all that is foul within creation, born the moment that the concepts of good and evil were first conceived. It is their divine purpose to exemplify the profane—by murdering their own kin, eating the flesh of sapient beings, and performing thousands of other atrocities, they define these acts as obscene and taboo, so that mortals know these acts to be crimes in the eyes of the holy. It is a role they must play, in the same way that a stage play must have an actor to serve as the villain, a role that damned all rakshasas from the moment of their genesis.</p>\n<p>Most rakshasas enjoy their role, in the same way an actor enjoys delivering a masterful performance, yet there is an element of tragedy to their existence. They are fated to serve solely as foils to others, to corrupt the unworthy and fall to the heroic, never free to forge their own path. They are condemned to perform the most heinous of deeds, even if it rankles their sensibilities and conscience. To do otherwise is to defy their nature and their purpose: the greatest sin a rakshasa can perform.</p>",

      "description": "<p>An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

In this form, a kishi's powerful jaws are almost impossible to pry loose and can crush a victim's bones in a matter of moments.</p>\n<p>Kishi range widely in their physical features, and their height and weight vary as much as the people whose communities they infiltrate.

These ultimate sadists derive pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end. The more uptight, prudish, or haughty a target, the better-for nothing satisfies kishis as much as earning (and destroying) the trust of someone who rarely grants it.</p>\n<p>When kishis get their new friends or lovers alone, they choose the most dramatic moments to reveal their true monstrous forms and clamp their jaws down on their victim.

Kishis consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime-even lapping up any spilled blood, claiming the victim's treasures as their own, and cleaning the murder scene as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Few things can bind a community together as swiftly as uncovering a kishi.

Presented with a potential meal, the rezzelki moves quickly to smash its feast with its wide tail.

Of course, this attention can be a double-edged sword.
