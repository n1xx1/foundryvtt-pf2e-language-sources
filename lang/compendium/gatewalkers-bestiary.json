A tupilaq manifests from hateful magic-a thing that can be created only by someone who believes they were grievously wronged. When a terrible, unforgivable crime is committed against someone with great skill at carving and who has knowledge of the proper ritual, the aggrieved can channel their grief and hate through whispered incantations to bring a tupilaq to life.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the same emotions used to create a tupilaq often lead to even greater tragedies. Functionally immortal but built for vengeance a tupilaq lacks the reason or discernment to do anything other than pursue the goal imbued by its creator. A wish to utterly destroy an enemy can lead a tupilaq to slaughter an entire clan or settlement, killing until it has slain everyone even remotely related to the original offender. There are many stories where a tupilaq ends up causing more tragedy for its creator than the crime that precipitated its creation. The most common tales feature the tupilaq eventually murdering its creator's spouse or family members due to a distant relationship to the original target that no one knew about.</p>\n<p>Tupilaqs' animating energies aren't tied to their original functions, and the creatures typically long outlast their creators, their victims, and often any who recall the reason for their creation. They might fall into a sort of hibernation once they've achieved immediate vengeance, but they frequently reawaken to continue their rampage against unsuspecting targets ignorant of their involvement.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters might occasionally summon these constructs. Summoned tupilaqs, hauled unceremoniously from their vengeance, become near-frenzied combatants, unleashing every offensive ability in their arsenal to break free. These reactions aren't strategic or considered, but an instinctual, almost programmed need to return to their true purpose. Conjurers should be wary about tupilaqs employing spells that might be turned against their summoners, such as a fireball spell \"accidentally\" placed such that it incinerates the spellcaster and returns these creatures from whence they came.</p>",

As they imparted their wisdom, these spirit guides took physical forms, becoming the wild animals that exist today. Though spirit guides bestowed most of their gifts unto mortals in ancient times, a rare few continue to lurk in forgotten or as-of-yet-undiscovered corners of the physical world.</p>",

They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>",

Desa-desa fur tends to match their environment—most are dark green and brown—and is punctuated by patterns of small, bubble-like bladders that protrude from the creature's skin like transparent boils. Every desa-desa has a different bladder pattern, and this distinctive anatomical feature is key to the creature's survival.</p>\n<p>Desa-desas' lives revolve around a little-understood (and likely magical) process by which the creatures transform water into its constituent gaseous elements. A desa-desa stores these gasses in the polyp-like bladders, which are lined with an electricity-conducting material that allows the creature to create sudden blasts of fame in all directions.</p>\n<p>As a predator, the desa-desa's most dangerous attack is its bite, which passes along its bubble venom, which can ravage the fluids in the victim's own body. This reaction causes water in the target's cells to split rapidly, creating bubbles of gas that percolate through the creature's flesh to its skin, where it balloons outward in large, agonizing blisters before popping. The combustible gasses in these blisters also make a creature particularly susceptible to fire attacks—such as the desa-desa's defensive blast.

Matched with their boundless capacity for egotism and enormous life spans, elder things often see themselves as the most learned and advanced species on any planet they visit, and tend to treat most other forms of life like a scientist might treat experimental stock. While not generally inimical or violent, their nature often puts them at odds against other societies they encounter, and war is a time-honored solution. The elder things rarely shy away from using violence to secure their own territory and their perceived right to experiment and explore.</p>\n<p>A typical elder thing is 6 feet tall from head to foot, with a 7-foot wingspan. Their bodies are radial in nature, with five wings, five tentacle-like arms that each end in a writhing nest of tendrils, and five eyestalks. At one end of their barrel-shaped bodies are several larger tentacles they use for combat and locomotion, while at the other, at the center of their five eyes in their starfish-shaped heads, sits a single mouth surrounded by multicolored cilia. An elder thing's language is a mix of piping and whistling sounds, but they can vocalize a wide range of other languages as well—albeit with a strange, high-pitched accent.</p>\n<h3>Space Travelers</h3>\n<p>An elder thing can travel through outer space via flight, but it doesn't do so at a greater speed than its normal fly Speed. When an elder thing wishes to travel through the void of space, it typically aims itself in the direction it wishes to go, then enters a timed hibernation so that it wakes at a point where it nears its destination.</p>",

They flourish most in high altitudes and cold climates, where they survive by dazzling small prey with their iridescent blossoms before crushing them to death with impossibly strong tendrils. The blood and decomposing flesh of their prey seep into the ground like fertilizer for glimmervines' roots to absorb as nutrients. Because scarps and gulleys caked with gore tend to deter future victims, glimmervines instinctively know not to linger in one spot for long.</p>\n<p>Glimmervines are mostly dormant during the day. Clinging to the sides of mountains and cliffs, they're easily mistaken for mundane climbing plants such as ivy or morning glory. When night falls, though, glimmervines' spectacular reflective flowers make their entrancing nature plain for all to see.</p>\n<p>Glimmervines are closely related to assassin vines, who employ similar ambush tactics and feeding behaviors, but the former is easily discernible by the shiny white blooms in place of an assassin vine's small red berries. These petals are coated with iridescent veins that absorb sunlight during the day and give off an eerie yet beautiful glow at night. The glistening patina attracts pollinating insects.</p>\n<p>On their own, glimmervines don't pose much of a threat to most creatures. Though its root-based sensory organs are formidable in close proximity, a glimmervine can't sense creatures farther than 60 feet away, making escape as easy as getting out of range of their slow movement. The true danger of these plants comes from glimmervine thickets—dense patches of glimmervines that can entangle entire hillsides or ravines. Woe be unto a hapless traveler caught in the midst of a glimmervine thicket at sundown.</p>",

As they imparted their wisdom, these spirit guides took physical forms, becoming the wild animals that exist today.

Though this process is invaluable, it's also a vulnerability—one that the immolis has evolved to exploit.</p>\n<p>Immolises are psychic predators found all across Castrovel, especially underground and in cool environs. Mostly blind, they hunt by sensing the body heat of other creatures. When an immolis acquires a target, it focuses its innate psychic energies in an invisible beam aimed at its prey. The sudden influx of energy causes the target's metabolism to accelerate rapidly, spurring the creature's body to produce energy at a dangerous rate. This sudden rush of heat literally cooks the creature internally—innards burst, blood boils, and fat catches fire. The end result isn't just warm food, but a meal roasted to morbid perfection.</p>\n<p>An immolis's basic shape resembles that of a spidery, spindly frog covered in delicate scales. The head has a simian muzzle, the lips of which pull back to reveal a squid-like beak. Above the mouth, the creature has three pairs of nostrils, which fare and chuff as the creature hunts. Though they walk with a hunch, immolises climb with shocking speed.</p>\n<p>Unlike many other pyro-predators, immolises have a deep and paradoxical fear of fire, perhaps because they know how easily any flesh—their own included—can blacken and burn. As a result, they prefer to lair near water. This presents its own problem, however, as their heat sense is easily disrupted by creatures taking steps to hide their heat signatures, such as submerging themselves in water or snow. While intelligent enough to communicate and band together with others of their kind, immolises view all other species as either prey or threats and have as little interest in cultural exchange as in personal possessions.

The resulting shock wave can easily kill.</p>\n<p>Kareqs are thought to be related to Golarion's destrachans, though their similarities may simply be the result of convergent evolution. Unlike the stronger subterranean destrachans, kareqs are native to a variety of different environments, most often jungles and forests. A few sandy-colored species are found in the deserts of the Colonies, where formians regard the beasts as noble or, in some cases, practically sacred.</p>\n<p>Kareqs tend to be solitary predators, bold and unafraid, even willing to take on predators significantly larger than themselves. In combat, they keep their distance at first, softening up opponents with their boomstrikes before moving in for the kill with their claws.</p>\n<p>While they don't usually hunt in populated areas, kareqs are extremely territorial, and their desire to lay claim to tall landscape features can bring them into conflict with humanoids. During mating season, a kareq seeks height, climbing to the top of hills, boulders, or—if a settlement is particularly unlucky—towers and other buildings. From these perches, kareqs blast out their booming mating call which can carry for dozens of miles.</p>\n<p>A typical kareq stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder and is 10 feet long, weighing up to 300 pounds.</p>",

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

The secondary caster attempting the Crafting check creates a warding diagram to prevent the extraplanar creature from attacking or leaving during the bargain; if that caster fails or critically fails, then instead of the usual effects of a failure or critical failure of the secondary skill check, the extraplanar creature can attack or leave instead of negotiate. You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example). The creature can also attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the warding diagram breaks. Once the diagram is complete, you and the secondary casters each take your places at specific points at the diagram's edge where power concentrates.</p>\n<p>You conjure the extraplanar creature within your wards and negotiate a deal with it, generally to perform a task for you in exchange for payment. A creature that doesn't wish to negotiate at all can attempt a Will save to stay on its home plane. Most good and neutral extraplanar creatures feel that they have something better to do than cater to the whims of mortals and require a significant gift, especially if your task poses significant risks. Evil extraplanar creatures are more likely to accept a bargain for a lower cost as long as it allows them to wreak havoc on the Material Plane or inflict evil upon the world along the way. Monetary prices usually range from the cost of a consumable item of the creature's level for a short and simple task to a permanent magic item of the creature's level or more to persuade the creature to fight alongside you. However, some extraplanar creatures may want payments other than money, such as permission to cast a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Q690d3mw3TUrKX7E]{Geas} on you to fulfill an unspecified later favor or obtain ownership of your soul via an infernal contract. If you can't come to an agreement in a reasonable length of time after you've made your case, the extraplanar creature can return from whence it came at any time.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You call the extraplanar creature and bind it in the wards for up to a full day before it returns home, potentially allowing you to negotiate a better deal by threatening to leave it in the wards for the full day.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You call the extraplanar creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to call the extraplanar creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You call something dark and horrible, unbound by your wards, and it immediately attempts to destroy you.</p>",

Instead, they must harvest appendages and organs from the living to perpetuate their own lives.

Shorter rituals make quick repairs to wounded flesh-even consuming a nutrient-rich organ of a recently slain creature can provide quick rejuvenation-while more extensive changes require a full day's work.</p>\n<p>Because of the nature of their existences, no one single form remains common to umasi. Many graft any number of arms or legs of various sizes on their bodies, while others are conglomerations of exotic beasts, other humanoids, and whatever creatures they've hunted or scavenged. However, all umasi remain vaguely humanoid in shape. An umasi with additional arms can hold or wield more items at once, while additional legs or other limbs might grant increased Speed or new types of Speed. Concepts such as gender, ethnicity, and even recognizing someone based on their appearance are irrelevant to umasi. Instead, they value age and experience and identify themselves with iconic adornments or speech patterns.</p>\n<p>Despite their morbid nature, umasi are rarely at odds with living creatures. These opportunistic hunters value their self-preservation, but use fast-acting nonlethal poisons to subdue their targets for safe and minimally destructive harvesting. Few umasi harbor malice toward the living, but some possess a streak of self-loathing and search for powerful magics that might break whatever curse binds them to their current state.
