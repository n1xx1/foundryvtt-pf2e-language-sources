      "description": "<p>This massive bovine looks like a larger, wilder version of the domesticated cattle found throughout the Inner Sea region. During winter, vast herds of the animals roam the southern reaches of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, but as the ice high in the mountains begins to melt, the aurochs migrate south into Belkzen, following their ancestral route along the Flood Road. Once the water flows in earnest and turns to massive floods, the sudden surge of greenery provides the aurochs with all the food they need to survive.</p>\n<p>Aurochs are essential to life in Belkzen. Not only do the orcs there hunt the wild cattle for their meat, but they use every part of the aurochs, from hide to bones, to craft their weapons and tools. The aurochs' arrival prompts the beginning of the Flood Truce, during which the usually war-focused orc holds cease all hostilities to take advantage of this time of plenty.</p>\n<p>While groups of 20 or fewer animals are sometimes encountered, most aurochs travel in herds that stretch to the horizon. The land thunders under the weight of these herds, and the dust kicked up by their hooves is often spotted days before the aurochs—or the floodwaters that spurred their migration—arrive.</p>\n<p>Aurochs bulls stand between 6 and 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh around 2,500 pounds, although prodigious specimens can grow to over 7 feet tall and 3,000 pounds. Cows are smaller, standing near 6 feet at the shoulder and weighing up to 2,000 pounds. All aurochs have slightly curved horns that grow up to three feet long from base to spear-sharp tip.</p>\n<p>The aurochs is represented in much of Belkzen's artwork. Not only are the animals vital to survival in that unforgiving land, but their strength, power, and tenacity serve as potent symbols for orc holds.</p><h2>Aurochs Rolling</h2><p>Farmers throughout the Inner Sea often joke about cow tipping: sneaking up on an unsuspecting bovine and pushing it over while it sleeps. But since cattle sleep lying down, the animal usually has the last laugh. Nonetheless, some younger orcs in Belkzen spend evenings creeping up on sleeping aurochs to roll them over. This usually results in little more than a startled aurochs.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The wild animals that have adapted to the harsh environs of Belkzen are either fierce enough to scare off predators, tough enough to survive attacks, or smart enough to avoid trouble. Bristle boars are all three. Many orcs admire the bristle boar, viewing them as living symbols of the toughness Belkzen demands from its inhabitants. With their spiny manes, sharp tusks, keen noses, and irascible nature, the creatures are both intimidating and dangerous.</p>\n<p>Hunters throughout the Inner Sea region know that taking down a wild boar can prove deadly for the unprepared. Bristle boars—the name given to both male and female specimen—are even more challenging to kill. Further, their meat is sinewy, so few hunters even bother with the animals. For those who fell the beasts, the boars' spined hides often serve as trophies of the hunter's skill.</p>\n<p>Bristle boars are not as reliant on the Deluge as other animals in Belkzen. Though they're certainly found in the green areas that spring up during the annual flooding, sounders of bristle boars can survive even in desolate areas like the Dirt Sea, grubbing for sustenance where few others can. The Cleft Head Hold maintains a small herd of tamed bristle boars.</p>\n<p>The orcs have learned that, with the right trainer, the clever animals make excellent companions. Aside from their utility in battle, the boars are often used to sniff out the rare yellow truffles that grow throughout the hold.</p>\n<p>A typical bristle boar stands 4 feet tall and weighs roughly 200 pounds.</p><h2>Stuck Treasure</h2><p>Although they don't seek out shiny objects like some animals, bristle boars who evade hunters often escape with weapons embedded in their thick hides. The Empty Hand orcs tell of a famous bristle boar dubbed \"Silverspear\" after the silvery spear stuck in its hide. Stories claim the boar's spear is imbued with powerful magic, and while many warriors have hunted Silverspear to claim its weapon, so far none have succeeded.</p>",

Every night after the floods begin, a stormblood tiger is forced into its hybrid form until sun rises or the waters recede, usually 2–3 months later. The remainder of the year, stormblood tigers walk undetected among the population, often mistaken for hunters or scouts.</p><h2>Sought Out</h2><p>Because of the stormblood tiger's fearsome reputation and powerful abilities, some foolhardy orc warriors view becoming a stormblood tiger as a path to greatness—a blessing instead of a curse. In their minds, it's more important to have this power at hand during times of conflict than worry about disrupting peace during the Flood Truce.
