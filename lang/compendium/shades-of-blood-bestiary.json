Chupacabras prefer to prey on the weak and slow, often hiding in wait and watching potential prey for long periods before attacking. Spry and stealthy, they most often make their homes in areas of high grass and protective rock, their slightly reflective scales allowing them to blend in well with such surroundings.</p>\n<p>Chupacabras prefer to eat lone travelers and farm animals (particularly goats) and leave little evidence of their presence apart from the grisly, blood-drained husks of their meals. Their tendency to stay out of sight combined with their naturally nocturnal activity often leads superstitious locals to conclude the worst, imagining that a particularly reckless vampire lives in the area.</p>\n<p>A typical chupacabra measures nearly 4 feet from its muzzle to the tip of its spiny tail, and it stands just under 3-1/2 feet tall. With their slight build and lightweight bones, most weigh close to 50 pounds. They mate rarely and only during the hottest months, with the females each producing a single egg that hatches into a tiny, dehydrated creature. The mother usually leaves helpless prey in her cave so the hatchling can immediately feed.</p>\n<p>Although chupacabras are typically solitary creatures, they have been known to form small gangs in bountiful areas. Members of these groups work well together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs. Regions where chupacabra activity like this is more common often have complex and colorful myths and tall tales about chupacabra capabilities or motive—and a few of the claims, such as that some chupacabras can fly, are all too true.</p>",

The creature tears their victim apart, allowing the blood to generously pool on the ground before lapping it up. Only after the blood is consumed do the beasts begin devouring flesh.</p>\n<p>Desmohunds are surprisingly loyal and often defend their masters to the death. Though they generally serve vampires, it isn't unheard of for the living to keep such creatures as pets, especially in areas like Ustalav, Nidal, and the Darklands, where they can sometimes be found prowling the grounds of foreboding estates.</p>\n<p>Vampire hunters carry a variety of tools to stalk and destroy their favored prey, but clever ones also carry items that can work against a vampire's allies too. Therefore, some carry bags of cinnamon or vials of eucalyptus oil to confuse and irritate desmohunds' keen sense of smell.</p><h2>Divine Origins</h2><p>Sources differ on the origin of desmohunds. Some legends state that Urgathoa created the first vampire hounds as pets to keep her company in undeath. Others claim that Nin distilled the best parts of vampires and wolves to create a nigh-unstoppable hunter. One story posits that Lamashtu created the first desmohunds, but Zura the Vampire Queen stole them from Lamashtu's realm of Kurnugia, claiming the creatures as her own. The only common thread among these tales is each god's insistence that they were the true creators of desmohunds, suggesting that there's an unknown reason the gods would vie for such a title.</p>",

Most succubi have a feminine true form (incubi, which usually have a masculine true form, are a different kind of demon), but regardless of gender, a lust demon is supernaturally beautiful or handsome, but with curving horns, bat wings, sharp claws, and a sinuous tail.</p>\n<p>When disguised as a mortal humanoid in the Universe, a succubus whispers into the ears of mortals, urging them to pursue their darkest and most destructive desires and pushing them into depravity, using magic only if persuasion fails. While mortals often fixate on succubi's application of sexual lust, these demons are can easily exploit lust for power, knowledge, fame, or any other desire as easily as more carnal appetites.
