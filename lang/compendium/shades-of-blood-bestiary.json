      "description": "<p>In folklore, bats and wolves are common elements of vampire storiesâ€”sometimes even the focus of such tales. The veil of night, however, conceals a wide array of vampiric creatures. Neither wholly wolf nor bat, desmohunds, also called vampire hounds, use their limited flight to swiftly close the gap between themselves and fleeing prey. This rapid movement, along with a penchant for hunting in perfect darkness, is often the cause of a survivor's confusion when asked to describe just what it was that attacked them.</p>\n<p>As their common name suggests, vampire hounds share a strong affinity with vampires. While the hounds can subsist entirely on flesh, they have a particular taste for blood. A desmohund attack is brutal and violent. The creature tears their victim apart, allowing the blood to generously pool on the ground before lapping it up. Only after the blood is consumed do the beasts begin devouring flesh.</p>\n<p>Desmohunds are surprisingly loyal and often defend their masters to the death. Though they generally serve vampires, it isn't unheard of for the living to keep such creatures as pets, especially in areas like Ustalav, Nidal, and the Darklands, where they can sometimes be found prowling the grounds of foreboding estates.</p>\n<p>Vampire hunters carry a variety of tools to stalk and destroy their favored prey, but clever ones also carry items that can work against a vampire's allies too. Therefore, some carry bags of cinnamon or vials of eucalyptus oil to confuse and irritate desmohunds' keen sense of smell.</p><h2>Divine Origins</h2><p>Sources differ on the origin of desmohunds. Some legends state that Urgathoa created the first vampire hounds as pets to keep her company in undeath. Others claim that Nin distilled the best parts of vampires and wolves to create a nigh-unstoppable hunter. One story posits that Lamashtu created the first desmohunds, but Zura the Vampire Queen stole them from Lamashtu's realm of Kurnugia, claiming the creatures as her own. The only common thread among these tales is each god's insistence that they were the true creators of desmohunds, suggesting that there's an unknown reason the gods would vie for such a title.</p>",

In this state, the tormonshild is virtually defenseless, but the magic that flows through its body allows it to grow quickly. After a few days, it swells into its more familiar adolescent form. A fully grown tormonshild resembles a two-foot-long frog with six legs, a mouth too large for its body, and flesh the color of a storm cloud. Once grown, the tormonshild decimates the local wildlife, sometimes attacking creatures up to twice its size. Being true omnivores, tormonshilds also feed on plants, preferring juicier crops like tomatoes and fruit. Many a villager has known the anguish of losing their livestock, gardens, and even a beloved pet to a tormonshild infestation.</p><hr /><p>Concentrations of intense magical energy often result in unusual weather phenomena, typically violent storms or other natural disasters, but sometimes they also create new entirely life-forms. Tormonshilds are born during artificially created storms, when magical energy combines with rainfall to transform the droplets themselves into living creatures. Tormonshilds rarely survive long after their creation; most meet grisly ends at the hands of local predators or dissolve as the magic that fuels their physical bodies fades. A tormonshild that survives its initial weeks of life eventually grows into a pest that menaces the local environment.</p><h2>Magical Rainstorms</h2><p>The rainstorms that produce tormonshilds occur more regularly than most people realize.
