The glistening pride's shimmering visage lures victims, then curses them with an inflated and competitive ego that tends to get them killed. The crusted sloth leaves victims wallowing in lethargy until they starve, while the shimmering greed imprisons would-be treasure seekers within shells of precious metal. The slithering lust's sweet scents enthrall victims with their deepest desires, distracting them as it feeds. But the most terrible of the sinsludges are the ravenous wrath, which uses blasts of devastating energy to feed, and the rancid gluttony, which consumes souls and leaves bodies behind as lethal undead.</p>",
