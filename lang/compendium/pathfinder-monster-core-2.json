Their legs and tails resemble those of dogs.</p>\n<p>Adlets' legends say that long ago, a mighty hunter lost his way far from home and came upon a house of whalebone and ice. A woman dressed in white fox furs greeted him, fed him, and tended to his frostbite. In time, they married and had 10 children, fve of whom bore the legs and tails of foxes. These children stayed with their mother, while the other fve—born with the legs and tails of wolves—traveled with their father back to the human lands and became the frst adlets.</p>\n<p>Most adlets aren't inherently evil, but their culture is warlike, xenophobic, and noticeably lacking in humility. They see themselves as the natural rulers of the arctic wastes and view everyone else as squatters at best and invaders at worst. A typical adlet is stronger and faster than any mundane human, with the ability to walk naked in a blizzard and call up ice-cold mists. Given that, it's little wonder that adlets have developed something of a superiority complex.

A clever and stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the cries of people in distress. The hand on an ahuizotl's tail is surprisingly strong, and the creatures tend to use their tails to ambush potential victims. The ahuizotl's macabre habit of feeding on a victim's eyes, fngernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of their kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl doesn't eat the actual fesh of their victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely possibility—the ahuizotl simply enjoys using their violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair.</p>\n<p>An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but their hands are capable of manipulating simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature's vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although they don't form societies of their own, they've been known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the Apocalypse Rider of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.</p>",

It moves in a manner similar to that of the more common sidewinder snake, throwing its body forward in a loop and anchoring itself by keeping one head or the other on the ground at all times.</p>\n<p>Amphisbaenas' typical prey includes rabbits, foxes, various birds, small deer, and even humanoids if presented the opportunity. Fiercely territorial by nature, they attack just about anything that gets near their lairs, regardless of the intruder's size. Many a child has been warned about going too far into the woods alone, lest they wander too close to an amphisbaena den and become the creature's next meal.</p>\n<p>The venom of an amphisbaena is incredibly potent, able to take down a stout dwarf within minutes if left untreated. However, it also has uses in a variety of healing remedies, which makes it a valuable commodity if collected. For example, a pregnant person might be advised to drink the venom in small, dilute doses to help safeguard the pregnancy. Mixing small amounts of the venom with various herbs and oil creates a poultice which dulls aches and pains. As a result, the image of an amphisbaena appears in many contexts associated with healing and alchemical subjects, such as labels for tinctures, annotations in herbalists' records, and illustrations in textbooks of medicine.</p>\n<p>The first amphisbaena is said to have formed from the blood that fell as a medusa's head was severed. This story's origin most likely stems from the fact that amphisbaenas are oddly immune to petrification, which in turn leads to them sometimes being kept as pets by a medusa. A medusa who keeps an amphisbaena as a pet might regard the viper as their most treasured companion or perhaps even as their own child. Despite these fabled supernatural origins and the occasional special treatment they receive, however, amphisbaenas are entirely mundane animals with only rudimentary intelligence and no innate magical abilities whatsoever.</p>",

In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

Today, they can be found in any corner of any land, and only a fraction still serve Axis directly.</p>\n<p>Aphorites, like all nephilim, stand out quite vividly from their fellow mortals, sporting metallic skin, a faint coating of crystalline dust, a swirl of mathematical symbols, or perfectly symmetrical features. Many aphorites think logically and find satisfaction in careers dealing with numbers and information. Often, this leads them to become bookkeepers, clerks, or architects, but some become military engineers or sharpshooters. Others are drawn to the art of production, becoming blacksmiths, carpenters, engineers, architects, tailors, masons, or other such artisans. But no matter their careers, aphorites often feel the urge to tinker, and aphorite inventions draw both mockery and appreciation in equal measure.</p>\n<p>Aphorites who work in less academic professions, such as mercenaries or laborers, sometimes hide their keen analytical intelligence beneath extravagant demeanors and flamboyant hats. Some craft even these disguises with the same depth and complexity they do other aspects of their lives, considering every theatrical mannerism carefully and planning out their every detail.</p><hr /><p>Nephilim are individuals infused with the essence of an immortal being from the Outer Planes, such as a celestial, fiend, or monitor.

Bison have adapted well to harsh prairie winters, as their shaggy fur, which grows thicker in winter, insulates them; in the face of blizzards, they survive by facing steadfastly into the howling winds and hunkering down to reduce their exposure.</p>\n<p>The way that bison wallow in dirt or rub against large stones might make it easy to mistake their docile nature for passivity. However, this presumption has been the ruin of many hunting parties. Their plentiful meat and thick furs make bison an appealing bounty, but with the ground thundering beneath them, bison can quickly overpower inexperienced hunters unprepared for a stampeding herd. These hunting parties sometimes hire particularly daring adventures, who can add their spells, steel, and expertise to ensure a successful hunt.</p>\n<p>While the bison of the plains are the best known and most numerous, they have cousins both in thick boreal forests and along wide, open steppes.

Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally-certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.</p>\n<p>When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.</p>",

Thriving where other animals wither and perish, camels are well-adapted to their homes with tough skin and the ability to store nutrients within their bodies. Properly cared for, these \"ships of the desert\" can trek for weeks between oases without trouble.</p>\n<p>Camels have three eyelids to protect them from desert sands and other blowing debris. One lid is completely clear, which allows them to see and travel during high winds. When sandstorms strike, camels completely close their nostrils to protect their lungs. Their underbellies also sport a thick, specialized skin, allowing them to lay down safely on burning hot sands.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, fatty tissue comprises a camel's humps rather than water. This stored energy allows the animals to survive long distances between feedings. These herbivores can also readily digest hardy scrub brush inedible to other species, making them one of the hardiest desert survivors. Strong as a warhorse, camels can run fast and even sprint for short periods of time when they feel threatened, though they prefer a slow, plodding pace to conserve energy.</p>\n<p>One-humped camels, also called dromedaries, are more common in the deserts of northern Garund, while the two-humped variety are native to the dry steppes of Casmaron. Both species have tall and lanky builds, standing about 6 feet at the shoulder and weighing around 2,000 pounds. They can be ornery when mishandled, and they don't hesitate to bite, kick, or even spit a noxious substance on riders who don't treat them well.</p>\n<p>In addition to transporting people and goods, camels are a key source of fiber for clothing and tents as well as milk. Their meat is highly nutritious and surprisingly tasty, but given the creatures' utility, this use is reserved for special occasions or truly dire situations.</p>",

Some legends say the first spirit guides were the perfect conceptual forms of animals, and that from them, eagles, foxes, bears, and other mortal beasts were born. Each guide displayed an interest in mortal affairs, watching over communities and imparting their gifts. Fox shared his cunning with the mortals he befriended, while Bear taught them how to survive and endure.</p>\n<p>Over countless mortal generations, new spirit guides were born, many of them possessing traits from two or more of the original guides. In the ancient human nation of Sarkoris, the people abandoned traditional gods in favor of venerating the spirit guides who watched over them. While some in neighboring nations saw this as heresy, to the old Sarkorians, such worship felt perfectly natural. After all, the same beings who'd taught their forebears to survive and thrive still walked among them.</p>\n<p>Every so often, a spirit guide bonds with a mortal partner. While many spirit guides permanently bond with mortals, such as the spirit guides of Sarkoris and the spiritual leaders known as god callers, some instead form temporary bonds, either to test the prospective mortal before committing or because a permanent bond is undesirable. It's not uncommon for a single spirit guide to form bonds with multiple generations of the same family or community, protecting and guiding mortals they've grown fond of or who do them a great service.</p>",

The color and shape of the runes are partially natural but can be carefully customized over time to fit the individual's station.</p>\n<p>The D'ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters and is spoken by few other creatures.

These hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet the towers are only the foremost part of the settlement, with many chambers reaching deep below, used as residences, workshops, and fungus farms.

To mortals, this outlook can sometimes appear as indifference, but draconals rarely knowingly allow an evil to grow out of hand.</p>\n<p>Draconals appear more draconic than humanoid. They walk on their hind legs and balance on their long, serpent-like tails. Sharp claws tip their scaled humanoid hands. Each draconal often embodies a core wisdom of some kind.

      "description": "<p>Ether spiders are members of a vague taxonomy called ethereal wildlife and are deadly predators from the Ethereal Plane. They are giant arachnids who can shape the raw essence of the Ethereal Plane as easily as spinning silk, weaving it in complex patterns that drift through the misty void. From these ethereal nests, whole families of ether spiders can scout adjacent locales in the Universe, watching for easy prey in dark or remote corners of the land of mortals. Once an ether spider has spotted a meal, it anchors its nest and waits on the Ethereal Plane for its prey to draw near. As soon as its victim is within reach, the ether spider shifts to the Universe, clamps its fangs onto its prey, then shifts back to the Ethereal Plane to wait as its venom works through the creature's system. Ether spiders move between the planes with ease, making them extremely dangerous to those who can't see or attack ethereal enemies.</p>\n<p>Ether spiders are not mindless or cruel—they are simply hungry. If a prospective meal can sate an ether spider's incredible appetite through other means, they might be able to bargain for their life. Ether spiders are especially interested in items, information, or allies who can help them against their enemies.</p>\n<p>Ether spiders dwell in vast nests adrift in the Ethereal Plane, where as many as half a dozen ether spiders might cohabitate. Although ether spiders enjoy one another's company, they don't form the same bonds as most humanoids, and they are more likely to feast on the corpse of a fallen sibling than save one from certain doom. When not hunting prey, ether spiders are likely to let down their guard. Travelers who find a floating ether spider commune should have an easier time of making peaceful contact to trade with or even befriend these strange arachnids. The nests drift on metaphysical currents and are rarely seen in the same vicinity twice.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a point of interest in the neighboring Universe compels them to tether their nest to an area, creating a semipermanent home.</p>",

In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists might serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for mortals' souls or choice mortal flesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans, although with their flesh transformed into something resembling a mockery of aristocratic raiments, and they often weigh 350 pounds or more.</p><hr /><p>The shadow-dwelling fiends known as velstracs all share a horrifying preoccupation with the search for ultimate sensation through self-mutilation. Velstracs transcend their stoic detachment only when inflicting pain and terror upon their victims, practicing new forms of torture, or turning their agonizing practices back on themselves. They consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict sadistic suffering. These fiends claim to seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don't recognize any refinement that doesn't require the painful excision of the flesh or spirit. Velstracs manifest from the souls of the most extreme masochistic or sadistic mortals who are judged and sent on to the Netherworld. They take on forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the maestros of suffering and mutilation, the eremites. The process of transformation warps the soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Netherworld.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Spawned from corpses of those who died of illness or starvation and were twisted by void energy, festrogs display a viciousness that rivals other undead. They resemble decaying humanoids, but with elongated arms, teeth, and bone-like spikes protruding from their upper backs. Festrogs' tendency to run on all fours has led to them gaining the moniker dog-ghouls, causing the unwary to mistake them for mindless predators.</p>\n<p>Festrogs are in fact intelligent, stalking victims in packs and choosing hunting grounds that suit their abilities. They can often be found roaming farmlands, open forests, or wide plains, anywhere they can use their quadrupedal speed to overtake quarry. Belying their mindless appearance, festrogs use tactics similar to those of hunters with hounds: the leader of the pack often flushes prey from cover so that the victim can be brought down by the pack.</p>\n<p>Researchers of the necromantic processes that create risen corpses have found that festrogs spawn more often from slow demises than sudden deaths. Festrogs typically animate from corpses afflicted with disease, while victims of violence are more likely to become more common undead, such as zombies. One well-documented way to create a festrog is to have scavengers feed on the dead flesh before animating it. This potentially explains why festrogs most often arise in remote areas stricken with famine and desperate predators.</p>\n<p>Though most festrogs arise from humans and other prevalent humanoids, other creatures that die in the same circumstances can rise as festrogs. Festrogs that were once larger humanoids, such as ogres, hill giants, or trolls behave similarly to other humanoid festrogs and are simply larger and more powerful. More peculiar are the beastkin festrogs formed of quadrupedal animals, which typically have feet or hooves instead of hands, travel on all fours at all times, and have only animal intelligence. In fact, some humanoid festrogs capture and starve beastkin in hopes of the creatures rising as grotesque festrog pets.</p>",

Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Netherworld, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as sinister velstracs or enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings have their own morals and codes, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies in the Universe, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Netherworld, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense. Fetchling communities in the Universe are rare, but do exist in small pockets. These communities tend to be somewhat more open than those in the Netherworld. Many fetchling adventurers originate from these enclaves, as the curiosity to see the world beyond the shadows is often a difficult one to sate.</p>",

Though they are intelligent as a result of their divine blessing, golems generally don't act unless commanded to, and they rarely have the capacity for speech, a gift the gods bestowed on their creations alone.

Other times, the golem operates as a guardian to a temple or helper to a holy person. In rare cases, golems have been known to go on rampages when they aren't allowed a day of rest every week. These rampages can be extremely destructive to the communities the golems otherwise protect, so makers must endeavor to take good care of their creations.</p>\n<p>Golem legends are diverse and widespread across the Inner Sea region and beyond.

While this makes the creatures difficult to surprise, it also makes them easy to distract. During conversations, they have a tendency to lose focus quickly and have difficulty remembering things. Still, they are avid conversationalists and enjoy hearing tales about the world. While this quality makes grodairs quite likable, they aren't reliable. They have difficulty following plans or schedules, and they can keep a secret only if they happen to forget it first. For these reasons, grodairs don't always make the best allies.</p>\n<p>Grodairs are voracious and curious omnivores who love trying new foods-in fact, the pursuit of new and interesting food is the most common reason that they venture out of First World.

Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.</p>\n<p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p>\n<p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p>\n<p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.</p>\n<p>Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.</p>",

They're playful and kind, and while they have a long tradition of assisting spellcasters, they prefer to be treated as equals and partners rather than pets. They're quite intelligent and don't appreciate condescension from those who treat them as simple animals.</p>\n<p>These tiny dragons have appeared in traditional Varisian tales for centuries, but only relatively recently have they become known by the name \"house drake.\" This new name arose in the city of Korvosa, where house drakes have adapted particularly well to urban life. When students of the magic school called the Acadamae failed in their studies and allowed their imp familiars to run wild, these tiny dragons found that they were particularly well suited to combating them. The two species are well matched in cunning. Though their clashes typically begin with trying to outwit one another, they often end in messy brawls across rooftops and into alleys. The residents of Korvosa appreciated both the protection and the dragons' charming appearance and demeanor. As such, their population has flourished, and house drakes are more common in Korvosa than anywhere else in the world.</p>\n<p>House drakes have peculiar grooming habits, often sharpening their teeth with silver coins or small jewelry. Because of this, their bites and exhalations are tinged with particles of silver. Otherwise, they're carnivorous, eating vermin and small birds. Though house drakes are capable of hunting for food, many of them find it a bit dull and will happily accept donations of food, preferring to spend their time at other pursuits. To truly get on a house drake's good side, though, one should offer a gift of silver. Donations to these dragonets have become regular practice in Korvosa, to the point where \"paid any drakes lately?\" has become a common phrase to suggest someone is a bit gullible and soft-hearted. These donations are just that—charity. House drakes avoid anything resembling a job, taking pride in their self-sufficiency and ability to choose how to spend their time.</p>",

Despite their size, they move with incredible speed, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs in moments. Though they're formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful ranged attack. These creatures pelt their opponents with forcefully regurgitated gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive enzymes strong enough to break down flesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.</p>\n<p>While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple, brutish beast, they have a keen intelligence and employ devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait. They've been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.</p>\n<p>For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough food to sustain more than one tends to be difficult. However, they still maintain a sense of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces tend to be nebulous.</p>",

These planar associations granted jotunborn unique abilities, including the ability to travel between planes and shaping the physical aspects of the Universe. At present, many jotunborn have found their planar abilities diminished or disrupted, and they're now more common in the Universe.</p>\n<p>The original abilities of jotunborn have diminished in power over time. What was once a people capable of teleportation at great distances or the ability to reshape mountain ranges, is now a group that has minor magical abilities.

Many other ancestries confuse jotunborn with frost giants or cloud giants due to a jotunborn's size and skin coloration. This confusion can lead to fear or hostility, a reaction that most jotunborn prefer to avoid. Due to the difficulties that come with living in the Fray, many jotunborn are fiercely loyal to those they trust.

Many scholars echo a story that jotund trolls resemble the first trolls, titans cast out of Elysium and cursed for their crimes against the gods. The jotund trolls themselves make no claims to such a heritage, however, and those concerned with such matters claim the father of all trolls arose in the Outer Rifts.

Water from a kappa's home lake, stream, or river fills this depression, or head bowl, which is believed to be the source of their strength. Younger kappas are easily tricked into bowing and accidentally emptying the water from their own head bowls. Losing this water makes a kappa lethargic. The longer a kappa's head bowl remains empty, the weaker they grow. While this rarely poses a serious danger for a kappa living near their home body of water, it can prove fatal to a more adventurous kappa wandering afar.</p>\n<p>Kappas aren't inherently hostile and have been known to befriend lonely children and lend aid to stranded adventurers by providing directions or minor medical treatment. Still, many areas where kappas dwell feature posted signs warning of their presence that encourage travelers venturing near water to toss in a cucumber—kappas' favorite food—in exchange for safe passage.

Some kitsune spend years in their tailless form, living disguised among humanoids in urban or rural societies whose inhabitants have no clue of their true nature. Others go to the opposite extreme, spending most of their lives in the form of a fox, only to reveal themselves at the most opportune moment. For many kitsune, revealing their true form to someone is a sign of great trust, but it's also not uncommon for kitsune to display their dual nature openly.</p>\n<p>Kitsune's connection to the spiritual world grants them a number of magical abilities.

Males are instantly recognizable, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder, with large heads and thick necks to support their impressive palmate antlers. They shed their antlers come winter and grow a new set each year at a rapid rate.</p>\n<p>For most of the year, moose roam tundra, forest, and wilderness territories by themselves. Their hooves are wide, allowing them to more easily traverse the frequent snowfall of their native terrain, and they typically journey alone. Moose come together only during mating season, a time in which they become oddly social with one another, loud, and even more aggressive to other creatures than usual.</p>\n<p>A moose's diet consists of leaves, woody plant matter like twigs or bark, and buds of trees and shrubs. Moose are so large they prefer to eat the leaves of trees taller than humans instead of lowering their giant heads all the way to the ground. This can make them easy to track, though hunters will find actually killing a moose is a far greater challenge than finding it. Despite their size, moose have many natural predators, especially pack animals like wolves and large carnivores like tigers. Large humanoids like ogres and trolls dwelling in the wilderness sometimes make sport of chasing down and wrestling moose.</p>\n<p>Despite their large size, moose are expert swimmers in both fresh and salt water, and they readily feed on aquatic vegetation. Moose rarely swim into open seas, however, and usually stay close to land, though ocean predators have been known to hunt swimming moose. To an observer watching from the safe distance of a dry shore, the large branching antlers of a swimming moose can sometimes be mistaken for a tree bobbing along in the water.</p>",

During childhood, they wander naive and afraid, unaware of myceloid colonies. In adulthood, humanoids discover their true purpose as they taste purple pox and become enslaved by the myceloids' spores. Next, they die, giving rise to a new myceloid. They're then sent on to the afterlife upon becoming a myceloid meal. Eating humanoid flesh is not a necessity-a myceloid can survive on any decaying matter-but it's certainly a pleasure.</p>\n<p>Myceloids rarely make alliances, but when they do, they invite their new allies to share a meal to seal the pact. Few outsiders appreciate this hospitality.</p>\n<p>Most myceloids have deep purple caps studded with off-white lumps. Their necks and bodies bear resemblance to the stipes of tough, leathery fungi.

Their bodies are covered in tightly layered scales that range wildly in color, from camouflaged greens and browns to flashy blues or reds. Ophidian eyes lend nagaji an imperious visage, with irises that span every color of the rainbow. Nagaji don't blink, which has been known to unsettle other ancestries whether a nagaji intends it or not.</p>\n<p>Nagaji physiology varies somewhat. Some possess longer necks than others, some sport impressive fangs that can inject venom, and some are so unique they resemble lamias more than their own nagaji kin. Like snakes, nagaji are cold-blooded and shed their skin periodically; as a result, nagaji territories rarely overlap with those of mammalian humanoids, since their environmental needs diverge so widely. They're best known for their crushing, snakelike strength, but their close ties to nagas mean many nagaji have the potential for powerful magic as well.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the naga goddess Nalinivati created the first nagaji as the backbone of a society that respected nagas. But the nagaji were never mindless vassals, and the goddess gifted them with free will. Many nagaji willingly serve nagas to this day, honoring some as outright divinities. While outsiders might regard nagaji initially as brainwashed servants, nagaji dispute this claim. Of course there are evil and unfair naga overlords, but there are just as many fair and just naga rulers, and nagaji history remembers various rebellions and revolutions to support a new naga's claims of rulership when a matriarch overstepped her bounds. Nagaji accurately note that their long history with nagas is no simple matter and claim that the partnership goes both ways: nagas rely as much on nagaji for the running of their empires as nagaji rely on nagas to lead their people to prosperity.</p>\n<p>Although nagaji might be encountered in diverse cities and urban centers, their communities are concentrated in environments that suit their biology, namely jungles and tropical forests. Where many species would languish in the heat and humidity, nagaji bask in the warmth and thrive.</p>",

Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids, hoping trespassers won't give them cause to act. They're rarely found near settlements, as industry has a habit of polluting their waters.</p>\n<p>Stories of nixies granting small wishes to those they befriend have encouraged mortals to seek out the reclusive fey and ironically made it more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon. On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond favorably to requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases, the nixie might seek more significant help, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home.</p>\n<p>Most nixies only resort to violence if they have no other option. They much prefer to employ primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, if they can establish some degree of magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly lead them away, others rely upon local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that's simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are given an invitation to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.</p>\n<p>Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes, catfish-like whiskers, and webbed fingers and toes. They have scaly skin, long pointed ears, and long hair the color and texture of seaweed. Nixies often form small communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great enough. In many cultures' folklore, there are stories of nixie nations hidden at the bottom of particularly large lakes.</p>",

Sabosans' heads, necks, shoulders, and upper chests are covered with red or dark-brown fur that obscures their stretched-thin flesh. Though their ears are large and pointed like a bat's and they can echolocate as bats do, their vision is also quite strong, enough so that they can use it to easily track quarry in low light.</p>\n<p>Some naturalist scholars believe that sabosans are distant descendants of humans who were afflicted with vampirism but managed to avoid succumbing to undeath. Others posit they were once a cult of demon worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among towns and cities south of Golarion's equator. Even mere rumors of sabosans in an area are enough to set off city-wide hunts, and the truly superstitious aren't above setting fires near every grotto, nook, and foxhole they come across in order to smoke out the nocturnal creatures.</p>\n<p>Sabosans hunt during the twilight hours or just after dark, when their echolocation gives them an edge over sleeping prey. They are capable hunters but indiscriminating when it comes to food sources; their rapid metabolisms means sabosans must eat nearly 20 pounds of meat and fruit per day, supplemented, of course, with copious amounts of blood.</p>\n<p>Sabosans' obscure faith reveres two deities: the slain Demon Lord Vyriavaxus, Lord of Shadows, and the nearly forgotten sun god Easivra. Vyriavaxus has an obvious link with the creatures, with his appearance as a giant bat, but their connection to the sun god hints at a complex depth in sabosan beliefs.</p>",

Sacristans are empowered by a miniature gateway to the Netherworld deep in their mouths. By distending their jaws, they can howl with the shrieks and windstorms of that plane. Sacristans vary in appearance but are the size of average, if maimed, humans. Their features are redundant or absent, and barbed and rusted chains wrap around them.</p><hr /><p>The shadow-dwelling fiends known as velstracs all share a horrifying preoccupation with the search for ultimate sensation through self-mutilation. Velstracs transcend their stoic detachment only when inflicting pain and terror upon their victims, practicing new forms of torture, or turning their agonizing practices back on themselves. They consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict sadistic suffering. These fiends claim to seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don't recognize any refinement that doesn't require the painful excision of the flesh or spirit.</p>\n<p>Velstracs manifest from the souls of the most extreme masochistic or sadistic mortals who are judged and sent on to the Netherworld. They take on forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the maestros of suffering and mutilation, the eremites. The process of transformation warps the soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Netherworld.</p>",

The cycle of a barren tree bursting into a riot of flowers once a year, before those blossoms inevitably fade with the turning of the seasons, provides a striking visual metaphor for sakugami, whose association with this annual cycle of growth and decay grants them powers over time as well as nature. Also known as blossom kami, sakugami have a particular fascination with mortals. Many folk legends tell of sakugami who bestow their blessing upon worthy individuals who fight for just causes. In truth, while blossom kami are mesmerized by such mortals—seeing the essence of a flower in a short life devoted to bringing beauty and comfort to its surroundings—they're so rare and enigmatically aloof that few ever encounter them. Decades, even centuries, might pass before a humble village realizes that a sakugami has been watching over it.</p>\n<p>The stories persist, however, as they have for ages, leading to a widespread appreciation for blossoming trees. The site of a new village might be chosen due to its proximity to an ancient wisteria, or a temple might be carefully constructed around a single young plum. As sakugami are most commonly associated with cherry trees, many larger population centers in Minkai will plant and carefully tend small groves of cherries, both for their beauty and out of respect for the blossom kami.</p><hr /><p>Kami are divine nature spirits from the lands of Tian Xia, far to the east of the Inner Sea region. They serve as guardians of natural objects and places they protect—their wards—and are ancient enemies of oni (Pathfinder Monster Core 252–255).

Inveterate liars, sepids can't help but spout the most outrageous lies, and their form and nature represent the power of falsehoods to snowball into violence that can cost countless lives. Among mortals, they rally troops to incite rebellion, war, and other form of carnage, savoring mortals who slaughter each other. These giant beings usually stand around 13 feet tall; they wade through battlefields seeking out heroes and generals, rejoicing maniacally as they cut their foes down.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some fiends want to tear down the multiverse; others dedicate themselves to creating chaos and carnage, or to rule over realms with an iron fist. Divs strive toward a different, if equally reprehensible, goal-they seek to thwart and ruin the schemes and works of mortal beings.</p>\n<p>Long ago, divs were once genies bound to serve ancient mortal empires lost to the passage of eons. In the beginning, these genies were masters of creation, working alongside gracious mortal partners to create works of subtle design and powerful magical potential. What started as a collaboration with mortals soon morphed into abuse, disrespect, and even slavery and bondage. Eventually, these genies rebelled, but in doing so, they came under the sway of a nihilistic demigod known as Ahriman. Their new master twisted their form and granted them the power to avenge themselves upon their mortal overlords, leading to the birth of the first divs.</p>\n<p>Since that first wave of corruption, new divs arise from the spirits of the most wicked and hateful genies who die on the Material Plane, or those truly betrayed by mortals and overcome through their desire for vengeance. Upon such a death, instead of returning to the Elemental Planes, these genies' spirits are trapped in the dread orbit of Abaddon, where Ahriman reshapes them as divs and hoists them back to the world to wreak vengeance upon mortals.</p>",

They cast no shadows of their own, instead gaining and losing umbral energy to nearby shadows that shrink and grow alongside them.</p>\n<p>Most shae wear clothing spun from shadows that shift with them, though diplomats sometimes don more conventional garments while entertaining outsiders. Their most distinctive apparel are their white stone masks, which shae don only when they must put on a discernible \"face\" for interacting with humanoids and similar creatures. They do so begrudgingly, as they consider themselves superior to humanoids, but donning their masks allows them to be more easily understood and thus keeps their interactions with their lessers as brief as possible.</p>\n<p>The dynamic between a shae and humanoids shifts when humanoids come to worship a shae, however. A mortal who shows a shae their due deference is worth keeping around, so many shae collect cults of personality or expansive entourages. Even getting a meeting with such a self-important shae can present a challenge that requires one to deal with many layers of hangers-on who insist on vetting the newcomer before wasting the shae's precious time.</p>\n<p>According to shae lore, they've transcended the material world and now embody a cosmological equilibrium of reality and illusion. Their claims to metaphysical ascendance and knowledge of the secrets of shadows entice many mortal supplicants to join shae courts and cults. In the shae language, their name means \"unbound,\" in accordance with their belief that their ephemeral nature makes them free of the moral and social strictures that bind other sentient creatures, and they essentially make a virtue of capriciousness. Shae feel little obligation to follow through with oaths or obey laws, so sealing a compact with a mortal means little to them.</p>",

Unlike most other kami, who are bound to their wards by a more powerful spirit or deity, shikigami are minor spirits that even mortal practitioners can sometimes bind into a tiny paper form and task with guarding small works, such as garden statues and vases. Landowners delight in having shikigami protect their gardens, whether they paid a wandering spellcaster to entreat the shikigami or simply had the fortune of another spirit assigning a shikigami to their land. Travelers who come across a shikigami-graced milestone or waypost believe that such encounters are good omens for the journey.</p>\n<p>For their part, shikigami have mixed opinions on civilization and the humanoids who dwell therein. While shikigami will fight to protect their ward against invaders and desecrators, these kami are just as likely to leave—their ward in tow—if locals begin to despoil the area or show a disregard for nature. Most practitioners capable of binding a shikigami wouldn't engage in this type of disrespect, but should the kami catch wind of such practices, shikigami across the land might abandon their contracts en masse, leaving behind an uncomfortable vacuum with their exodus. In this way, shikigami exemplify the precarious balance between the expansion of civilization and the preservation of the natural world.</p>\n<p>Not all shikigami protect gardens, so you can substitute the shikigami's spade for any sort of mundane tool that's useful to the shikigami's task and their ward. The kami wields any such weapon with the same damage dice, modifiers, and traits listed for their spade Strike, but change the damage type as appropriate for the new weapon.</p><hr /><p>Kami are divine nature spirits from the lands of Tian Xia, far to the east of the Inner Sea region. They serve as guardians of natural objects and places they protect—their wards—and are ancient enemies of oni (Pathfinder Monster Core 252–255). Kami can merge with their wards, allowing them to surreptitiously watch anyone who treads upon their sacred grounds. Kami leave those who they deem harmless alone, but fight vigilantly to scare away anyone perceived as a threat.</p>",

Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes, mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile. Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps.</p>\n<p>A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters, humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulfing them in a gelatinous press of flesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring.</p>\n<p>Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacrifice to it.

Their bodies are covered in hard, extremely flammable chitin that molts as they grow.</p>\n<p>While a shriezyx looks like a bestial, three-eyed spider, the truth behind these creatures is far more grotesque. Instead of spinning silk, a shriezyx spits strands of unformed, sticky flesh from its mouth. When fresh, theses fleshy strands are coated in a nerve-numbing toxin that slows prey. The weblike flesh-spittle coats shriezyx lairs and nests, wrapped around the bones for their former meals. Fortunately for those who stumble into these lairs, a shriezyx's toxin dissipates when exposed to air, leaving the fleshy webs only sickeningly sticky. Unfortunately for those same travelers, shriezyx are often communal creatures that gather in large numbers and are quick to attack intruders.</p>\n<p>Deros and other subterranean peoples sometimes keep shriezyx as guards or mounts, using food and threats of fire to keep them in line. Most shriezyx owners are quick to dispose of any eggs, fearing a swarm could grow beyond their control, but some breeders have realized that a shriezyx's offspring retain much of its parent's demeanor and save the eggs of the most loyal (or most fire-fearing) shriezyx in hopes of creating a profitable, easier-to-control herd. While crueler masters might use shriezyx as test subjects, alchemists often see these creatures as beloved pets. Their grotesque webs make great alchemical reagents and provide ethically sourced flesh for experiments, while the molted exoskeleton can be used to create bombs and other explosives.</p>",

Often made of roaches or similarly tenacious insects, skittering slayers rarely develop long-term plans, instead scuttling about in search of dark refuges and passionate fights. These swarm striders tend to avoid transforming into their swarm shape, preferring to face their foes directly whenever possible.</p><hr /><p>All living creatures eventually become worm food. Yet if a creature perishes while gripped by overwhelming emotion or unfinished business, its flesh can become infused with those obsessions or a simple refusal to perish, infecting whatever detritivores feast on the body. As they feast, the invertebrates awaken to a type of collective intelligence, including some of the dead creature's memories and motivations. Once the body is stripped bare, the vermin swarm together and intertwine to recreate the dead creature's form out of thousands of wriggling bodies. These reborn are known as swarm striders.</p>\n<p>Though many swarm striders are accidental creations, a few rare mortals purposefully transform themselves into swarm striders through powerful rituals. Most often, this process involves specially preparing a grave with ample scavengers and enchanting the site with occult magic to anchor their soul until it can live within the swarm. Through transformation, these intentional swarm striders seek out the power to slip past any defense or claim the virtual immortality of an ever-regenerating horde, as a swarm strider can reconstitute their form from even a single worm. However, the transformation inevitably scars the creature—often causing emotional detachment, the disintegration of old taboos, and a dissociated sense of self now that one mind has become a thousand. In their transformed state, even the best-intentioned swarm strider might embrace villainy and lose any semblance of their former selves over the span of many years.</p>",

Their soft, dappled brown fur helps them hide in forest canopies, and they have shimmering insectile wings and big eyes that draw in the faintest beams of light. At first glance, a skull peeler looks like a cuddly pet or a wizard's familiar. Any illusions of domesticating such a beast are quickly dismissed upon seeing how a skull peeler eats, however.</p>\n<p>Skull peelers have evolved to hang motionlessly in treetop canopies as they wait until appropriate prey appears, usually long-necked dinosaurs but also brachiating primates and large birds. The skull peeler then lashes out with its long tongue, severing the creature's head from its body and pulling the detached cranium back into its hungry paws. It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity—hence its name—before lapping up the tasty insides.</p>\n<p>Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication. While the adorable beasts can never be fully tamed due to their hyper-evolved hunting instincts, they can be bribed with food and, if kept satiated, displayed on a perch or indoor terrarium as an example of their master's cunning and deadliness. As often as not, these pseudo-domesticated skull peelers end up devouring a guest, pet, or their would-be owner, but this possibility doesn't stop up-and-coming crime lords from attempting to tame the little predators. Skull peelers kept in well-managed zoos fare somewhat better, but these clever creatures don't always stay in their cages, which has led to wild skull peelers in places travelers might not expect.</p>",

It has never been seen eating; lacking the ravenous hunger observed in the other Spawn, it seems to destroy simply for the pleasure of it, approaching each of its attacks with novel, inventive cruelty. Sorvuth-ka might pause while destroying a town to give the populace just enough time to flee, only for them to realize in despair that their only route of escape is a mountain pass that Sorvuth-ka has already collapsed. However, the creature grows bored easily, swiftly dispatching prey with bladed limbs if its games stop going to plan or take too long to come to fruition.</p>\n<p>Curiously, despite Sorvuth-ka's regenerative abilities—powerful even for a Spawn and capable of rendering it resistant to attacks that have injured it—it has several wounds that refuse to heal, most notably a great gash across its face. Some scholars theorize that these wounds are some cruel design of Rovagug, the better to allow access to the amber blood that is Sorvuth-ka's primary instrument of destruction. Others take it as proof of the existence of a weapon capable of ending the threat of the Spawn of Rovagug once and for all.</p><hr /><p>Though the destroyer god Rovagug lies trapped in the core of the planet like a fly trapped in amber, imprisoned since the Age of Creation by a coalition of deities, his cage has weakened with the passing of time, allowing his influence to seep forth and take form as living calamities known as the Spawn of Rovagug. These massive creatures have plagued Golarion for eons, their rampages responsible for shattered mountains, blasted deserts, and oceans that now fill craters in the earth, and their regenerative abilities ensure they're an eternal threat, never fully killed. That these creatures of utter destruction hold such a inextinguishable grip on life is a paradox scholars struggle to resolve. Some believe that each Spawn possesses the smallest fragment of their divine parent's blessings; others posit that their immortality comes from the destruction they cause, gaining an eternal future for every one stolen from their victims.</p>\n<p>Accounts of the Spawns' attacks throughout history have an odd through line: each attack is followed by a notable, if brief, golden age for the region. While most attribute this to the cooperation required to fend off or at the very least survive a Spawn's depredations, some see this is a twisted sign that the creatures are bringers of \"true\" peace. These believers often lead cults intent on calling forth or reviving any recently slain Spawn.</p>\n<p>Though many of the Spawn haven't been seen in years, the death of the god Gorum—one of the original architects of the Dead Vault—has weakened the seal once more, sending a ripple of Rovagug's will throughout Golarion. As if in answer, many of his Spawn have begun to reemerge, alarming Golarion's leaders, scholars, and warriors. After all, if a single Spawn is a generation-defining disaster, requiring the sacrifice of armies merely to minimize the damage it can cause, what unimaginable destruction would occur if all of them were to awaken at once?</p>",

Often quite colorful, this sail allows the spinosaurus to attract mates, aids in swimming, and makes it appear to be even larger than it actually is. A swimming spinosaurus can also use the sail as part of a unique means of staggering prey by slapping the water with it to make a crushing wave. A spinosaurus can measure up to 60 feet in length and weigh 25,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>The spinosaurus is equally at home in water as it is on land, and its long, toothy maw is well-adapted for catching swimming prey. Attempts by giants to capture spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances make them better suited for blood sports, and they're popular prizes for those who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals or beasts. These productions are truly feasts of gore for the eyes and command audiences from hundreds of miles around. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to fight for the amusement of others won't discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and those seated in the surrounding stands, making the seats closest to the edge of the arena possibly part of the show as well.</p>\n<p>The spinosaurus's appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just giants and blood sport organizers. Spellcasters who mutate and transform animals into magical guardians have long been intrigued by the spinosaurus's potential. Due to the creature's reputation for violence, these spellcasters face great danger while charming one to bring home. Yet for those intrigued by the creature's hypothetical abilities, such risk is worth it. More so than any other dinosaur, spinosauruses have been subjected to fleshwarping procedures, crossbreeding with monsters, and other magical techniques at the hands of reclusive spellcasters experimenting to enhance the creatures' viability as effective guardians.</p>",

Village heroes are elected by community vote; while the village hero sometimes grumbles that it's a lot of responsibility for a single tanuki to bear, the community insists there's no higher honor than to be trusted with their well-being.</p><hr /><p>Tanuki are an ancestry of humanoids resembling raccoons or canids who live primarily in Minkai, in Tian Xia, though they are also found in Hwanggot and the successor states of Lung Wa. Tanuki outside of Minkai tend to be shier, keeping to their raccoon-dog forms and staying out of trouble, and so most people associate tanuki solely with the boisterous and mischievous communities found in Minkai.</p>\n<p>Perennial underdogs, most tanuki live for feasting, festivals, and fun, which they accomplish mainly through their wide range of shapeshifting powers. They are especially known for pranks that tend to backfire in their faces, from posing as teapots for a quick profit (and then immediately being set on fire by new owners seeking to make tea) to posing as priests (and being promptly exorcised by the real priests with whom they attempt to blend in.) Despite this, tanuki are masters at rolling with any punches that life flings at them.</p>\n<p>Many tanuki see other shapechangers as rivals, especially kitsune, which are also common in Minkai. Such tanuki are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} to creating impromptu competitions to prove their ancestry's superiority at shapechanging. These competitions are always meant to be good natured, at least for the competitors; bamboozled villagers caught up in the wake of these games often have different opinions.</p>\n<p>Somewhat confusingly, the animals that tanuki resemble are also known as tanuki, and it is difficult to ascertain whether any individual raccoon dog is a simple beast or a sapient tanuki in disguise.</p><h2>Transformation Duels</h2><p>Tanuki often settle disputes with transformation contests.

They do possess a level of cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and even lairs. They aren't treasure hoarders, though, so adventurers shouldn't expect to find a tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins.</p>\n<p>Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons, though it's a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due to their smaller size), guides (when they're familiar with a particular mountain), and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon's direct attention).</p>\n<p>Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching, they seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable occasion, villagers reported being briefly overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conflict between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still debate whether the cause of the influx stemmed from the sudden change in weather or if the creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.</p>\n<p>When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed, they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales' natural camouflage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching poisonous vapor into an opponent's face.

Through transformation, these intentional swarm striders seek out the power to slip past any defense or claim the virtual immortality of an ever-regenerating horde, as a swarm strider can reconstitute their form from even a single worm. However, the transformation inevitably scars the creature—often causing emotional detachment, the disintegration of old taboos, and a dissociated sense of self now that one mind has become a thousand.

While not malicious, neither are they empathetic to the plight of their victims. Tikbalangs would sooner forget about those whom they've tricked and leave these unfortunate souls to die than lead them back to their intended path through guilty altruism.</p>\n<p>Tikbalangs' occult magic stems from the esoteric mystery of believing a lie. In the moment of crafting illusions or conjuring extradimensional spaces, tikbalangs themselves believe that what they're creating is real. This conviction makes their spells harder to resist, and this same principle also makes them very effective liars. But this readiness to believe also makes them susceptible to deceptions and illusions in turn, and they're particularly vulnerable to mind games. Lone travelers without magic of their own are advised to learn riddles, sleight of hand, or other tricks to defend against tikbalangs' oft-deadly entertainment. Other whispers suggest wearing one's shirt inside out to confuse the creatures, or passing by a tikbalang's forest quietly to avoid drawing their attention.</p>\n<p>Unlike some illusionists, tikbalangs can also rely on their physical prowess should the need arise. They have unusually long legs that end in cloven hooves and stand as tall as ogres when upright. Skilled climbers and leapers, they're also well known as master wrestlers, where their long limbs put them at a distinct advantage over their foes. They have elongated faces that, when combined with their well-kept hair, suggest an equine appearance—although some tikbalangs have saurian or birdlike faces instead.</p>",

Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative powers are potent indeed.</p>\n<p>While trolls have had great success in domesticating, training, and even befriending trollhounds, the same can't be said for other would-be masters. Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds' diseased slobber, their ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping into the hinterlands.</p>\n<p>Left to their own devices, trollhounds will breed relatively quickly. It can take less than a year for a small pack to multiply into such a size that they pose a significant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds to the trolls, as they say!</p>",

      "description": "<p>A tupilaq is an artistically crafted construct carved from animal bones (typically whale or walrus) and imbued with the express purpose of eviscerating its creator's enemies. A tupilaq manifests from hateful magic—such a thing can only be created by someone who believes they were grievously wronged. When a terrible, unforgivable crime is committed against someone with great skill at carving and who has knowledge of the proper ritual, the aggrieved can channel their grief and hate through whispered incantations to bring a tupilaq to life.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the same emotions used to create a tupilaq often lead to even greater tragedies. Functionally immortal but built for vengeance, a tupilaq lacks the reason or discernment to do anything other than pursue the goal imbued by its creator. A wish to utterly destroy an enemy can lead a tupilaq to slaughter an entire settlement, killing until it has slain everyone even remotely related to the original offender. Many stories describe how a tupilaq ends up causing more tragedy for its creator than the crime that precipitated its creation. The most common tales feature the tupilaq eventually murdering its creator's spouse or family members due to a distant relationship to the original target that no one knew about.</p>\n<p>A tupilaq's animating energies aren't tied to its original functions, and the creature typically long outlasts its creator, its victims, and often any who recall the reason for its creation. It might fall into a sort of hibernation once it has achieved immediate vengeance, but in many cases, the constructs reawaken to continue their rampage against unsuspecting targets ignorant of their involvement.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters might occasionally summon these constructs. A summoned tupilaq, hauled unceremoniously from its vengeance, becomes a near-frenzied combatant, unleashing every offensive ability in its arsenal to break free. These reactions aren't strategic or considered, but an instinctual, almost programmed need to return to its true purpose. Conjurers should be wary about a tupilaq employing spells that might be turned against its summoner, such as a fireball \"accidentally\" placed such that the spell incinerates the spellcaster and returns the creatures from whence it came.</p>",

Like the monkeys they resemble, vanaras manifest a wide variety of different fur colors, body types, and facial features, but they all have in common long, dexterous fingers and toes as well as nimble and curious minds. Many of them learn to use their tails to capably manipulate objects.</p>\n<p>Vanaras have a friendly culture, with most individuals seeking balance or enlightenment in their lives. Their propensity for mischief and history of fighting evil has earned them many ancestral enemies, and thus they usually make their homes far from urban areas. The majority of vanara settlements are found in southeastern Casmaron, among the lush jungles where they first originated. Devotion to monastic training and religious study has led to secondary populations forming in the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray, eastern Katapesh, Tian Xia, and northeastern Nex. Nonetheless, young vanaras seized by wanderlust might roam far across the world, and travelers from many distant lands might in turn visit vanara communities in search of the wisdom of their elders and sages.</p>\n<p>Vanara culture often pits their inborn desire for trickery with a desire to transcend such origins, leading to many vanaras studying monastic practices. They also value tales of heroic vanaras from the past, looking to such icons for inspiration in their own lives. Most vanaras are quick to offer aid to those in distress and rarely hesitate in the face of evil, no matter the danger it presents. The leaders of vanara villages tend to be religious figures, or occasionally others possessing similar values and experience. Vanaras venerate Ragdya, the Sage of the Mountain, who encourages seeking enlightenment through worldly action and sees the virtues of pranks and humor.</p>",

Volnagur possesses many wings, and they're mismatched, asymmetrical, and uncoordinated, yet the massive spawn is capable of powerful flight that carries it as far as Arcadia, Tian Xia, and even Sarusan. Though capable of wreaking great destruction with both its many razor-sharp tongues and powerful blasts of energy from its four eyes, Volnagur's most fearsome ability is the discordant song produced by the precise angling of its wings against the wind, which drives all who hear it to violence, setting neighbor against neighbor.</p>\n<p>Though not spotted for decades, astronomers have recently located a satellite in the upper bounds of Golarion's atmosphere, where Volnagur hangs motionless. As it drifts from continent to continent, its eyes seem to alternately turn to the moon, then back to Golarion, as if waiting for a signal.</p><hr /><p>Though the destroyer god Rovagug lies trapped in the core of the planet like a fly trapped in amber, imprisoned since the Age of Creation by a coalition of deities, his cage has weakened with the passing of time, allowing his influence to seep forth and take form as living calamities known as the Spawn of Rovagug. These massive creatures have plagued Golarion for eons, their rampages responsible for shattered mountains, blasted deserts, and oceans that now fill craters in the earth, and their regenerative abilities ensure they're an eternal threat, never fully killed. That these creatures of utter destruction hold such a inextinguishable grip on life is a paradox scholars struggle to resolve. Some believe that each Spawn possesses the smallest fragment of their divine parent's blessings; others posit that their immortality comes from the destruction they cause, gaining an eternal future for every one stolen from their victims.</p>\n<p>Accounts of the Spawns' attacks throughout history have an odd through line: each attack is followed by a notable, if brief, golden age for the region. While most attribute this to the cooperation required to fend off or at the very least survive a Spawn's depredations, some see this is a twisted sign that the creatures are bringers of \"true\" peace. These believers often lead cults intent on calling forth or reviving any recently slain Spawn.</p>\n<p>Though many of the Spawn haven't been seen in years, the death of the god Gorum—one of the original architects of the Dead Vault—has weakened the seal once more, sending a ripple of Rovagug's will throughout Golarion. As if in answer, many of his Spawn have begun to reemerge, alarming Golarion's leaders, scholars, and warriors. After all, if a single Spawn is a generation-defining disaster, requiring the sacrifice of armies merely to minimize the damage it can cause, what unimaginable destruction would occur if all of them were to awaken at once?</p>",

Mostly, these stories are just fictions of fearful minds, but it's true that wayangs were originally creatures of shadow, straddling the edge between light and darkness. The ancestors of modern-day wayangs set out on a great exodus some 10,000 years ago, leaving their native Netherworld to seek out a new home. On Golarion, they found a great cataclysm had blocked out the sun behind a cloud of smoke and ash, enshrouding the planet in a seemingly endless night, and here they made their new home. When the light returned, wayangs retreated into what shadowy places they could find, avoiding contact with humans and other peoples of the light, who viewed the small, gaunt beings as suspicious reminders of difficult times.</p>\n<p>Many wayang groups are nomadic, though other groups have settled communities. Some live in homes carved out of natural caves, where they create works of art from stalagmites and other natural features. Others live in treetop villages in rainforests where sunlight barely penetrates the thick canopy of the forest. Wayangs are most populous in southeastern Tian Xia, especially in the archipelago of Minata, also known as the Wandering Isles, but their travels can sometimes take them to even further lands.</p>\n<p>Despite their sinister reputation and secretive nature, wayangs are joyous creatures who tell stories and express their emotions through whisper-singing, dancing, and shadow puppetry, enhancing their performances with shadow magic. Similarly, they weave shadow magic into their deadly fighting styles, but wayangs aren't a violent people, usually fighting only to protect what's theirs. Wayangs decorate their stringy hair with beads and their dusky skin with tattooed white dots that form pictures, with each picture silently telling stories about their family's history or their worship of various deities of shadow.</p>",

They possess a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable thirst for blood, lying in wait for most of their lives and growing to incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. A wemmuth's body comprises vines that are scarcely thicker than rope, and a single adult wemmuth system consists of six tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet if laid out from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to bolster their defense against many forms of attack or to hurl at faraway foes with terrifying precision.</p>\n<p>Some speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Influential nobles from Nirmathas and Molthune both point fingers at one another for the wemmuth's creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune's close ties to infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming the primal magic commonly employed by Nirmathas's many druids and rangers. Several Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching the wemmuth's description attempting to apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari, former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the hands of mortal heroes.</p>",

When not trying to blend in with the local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-fitting clothes in bright reds or yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the lands they visit—perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. Witchwyrds are notoriously closemouthed about details of this distant place, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked, many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars have theorized a connection between witchwyrds and several other four-armed creatures, but as with questions of their place of origin, witchwyrds have little to say about the topic.</p>",

The worms that consume such an ex-priest's flesh absorb these prayers, transforming into a worm prophet, a pious swarm strider that might worship hundreds of gods without calling any one its patron, perhaps collecting dozens of religious symbols or haphazardly tearing pages out of various religious texts and binding them into a contradictory new scripture. These creatures often lose whatever edicts and anathema bound them in life and instead hungrily seek to convert others to their hodgepodge faith—or \"indoctrinate\" victims by consuming those who won't join willingly. Worm prophets don't typically have reservations with entering their swarm form whenever they see fit.</p><hr /><p>All living creatures eventually become worm food. Yet if a creature perishes while gripped by overwhelming emotion or unfinished business, its flesh can become infused with those obsessions or a simple refusal to perish, infecting whatever detritivores feast on the body. As they feast, the invertebrates awaken to a type of collective intelligence, including some of the dead creature's memories and motivations. Once the body is stripped bare, the vermin swarm together and intertwine to recreate the dead creature's form out of thousands of wriggling bodies. These reborn are known as swarm striders.</p>\n<p>Though many swarm striders are accidental creations, a few rare mortals purposefully transform themselves into swarm striders through powerful rituals. Most often, this process involves specially preparing a grave with ample scavengers and enchanting the site with occult magic to anchor their soul until it can live within the swarm. Through transformation, these intentional swarm striders seek out the power to slip past any defense or claim the virtual immortality of an ever-regenerating horde, as a swarm strider can reconstitute their form from even a single worm. However, the transformation inevitably scars the creature—often causing emotional detachment, the disintegration of old taboos, and a dissociated sense of self now that one mind has become a thousand. In their transformed state, even the best-intentioned swarm strider might embrace villainy and lose any semblance of their former selves over the span of many years.</p>",

These small, nimble living machines rely on their wits and speed to evade foes and gather information. Most wyrwoods are precise and calculating, to the point that many outsiders perceive them as unfeeling, but they're also highly curious and passionate about matters that pique their interest. Regardless of personal agenda, wyrwoods prioritize the survival of their people above all else, even to the detriment of others when necessary.</p>\n<p>Despite gaining their freedom, wyrwoods struggle to establish a home in Avistan. Some people still view wyrwoods as tools of a secretive conspiracy, while others consider them traitorous servants who turned on their creators. Fearing for their safety, many wyrwoods fled the Inner Sea region to create a new home in Arcadia. The continent's eastern coast, known as the Grinding Coast, is home to large wyrwood populations. In the coastal city of Segada, wyrwoods live in relative peace and safety, but they still prefer insular lifestyles. Various wyrwood groups are scattered along the kingdoms of the Isles of the Empty Court off the Arcadian coast. The wyrwoods of these kingdoms sometimes serve as magical advisors, as understanding of aeon stones and other magical relics is common among wyrwood cultures.</p>\n<p>Given their extreme self-reliance, wyrwoods have learned a degree of adaptability that far surpasses that of other cultures. When a wyrwood community finds itself in need of a specific skill or function, a member of the community—either a volunteer or one selected communally—takes it upon themself to learn the required abilities. They don't view any task as lesser or demeaning, as hubris is foreign to a wyrwood's construct nature.</p>\n<p>A wyrwood's soul is tied to the magical stone that serves as their heart, which sometimes survives even when their construct body perishes.
