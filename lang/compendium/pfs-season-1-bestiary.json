They do this by unhinging their jaws and slowly swallowing the victim from head to foot.

There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Its ability to follow orders is granted by the otherwise mindless humanoid brain that floats in its dome-like head. In exceptionally rare cases, the brain used in its creation might retain fragments of memories or even actual intellect, resulting in an alchemical golem with a personality and agenda of its own.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

      "description": "<p>Ogre gluttons take the act of feeding to a horrific extreme, capable of extending their already cavernous mouths wide enough to gulp down a halfling. Stories of ogre gluttons being tricked into eating razor-edged shields or barrels filled with poisoned meat are common, but such tales are of little consolation to those who have been gobbled down whole by these ravenous giants. In addition to their sadistic table manners, ogre gluttons have a disturbing knack for coming up with violent \"games\" that are little more than drawn-out torments, yet those who somehow manage to beat a glutton at the rules of its own game can often enrage and frustrate the ogre enough that the resulting tantrum is more than enough distraction to afford a last-ditch escape from doom.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ogres embody brutish, amoral violence and cruelty. Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are as strong as they are cruel. Ogres are sadists that enjoy remorseless murder, torture, degradation, and mutilation in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on smaller humanoids-the smaller and more beautiful, the better-ogres promise a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp. But for all their creativity in developing methods of violence, ogres often remain too dim-witted to realize that their playthings lack an ogre's robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, so most captives die far sooner than the ogres might prefer. Such a fate is perhaps preferable however, as those who survive too long as ogres' playthings suffer lasting mental scars from the horrifying abuse. A captive able to keep their wits can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, meatier captives, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. Ogres practice incest regularly, believing that it makes for stronger familial bonds, and most ogres are misshapen or mutated from generations of inbreeding. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"-usually the family's patriarch or matriarch-while other ogres in the family learn to obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy. These lairs are filthy and frequently contain all-too-recognizable evidence of their depravity.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Reefclaws are aquatic monsters that resemble huge shrimp or lobsters. As one might expect from its name, a reefclaw's oversized claws are powerful weapons with their vicelike grip and the ability to inject potent venom into unfortunate prey.</p>\n<p>While reefclaws can't speak, they are intelligent enough to understand the local language of humanoids near their hunting grounds. The creatures sometimes listen to conversations, either to gain intelligence on the best place to ambush aquatic or land-dwelling prey, or merely for entertainment value-reefclaws are particularly fond of listening to people with high-pitched voices. Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous-they've been known to tip over small flshing boats and attack those who fall overboard.</p>\n<p>Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring.</p>\n<p>Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins. According to those who have a taste for reefclaw flesh, the meat is either delectably sweet or slightly tangy (in the case of warm-water reefclaws). Most civilized people who know of reefclaws' intellect find the act of eating them distasteful, but this does not dissuade unscrupulous nobles in coastal regions, for whom reefclaw meat is a delicacy well worth the expense. Likewise, fisherfolk whose focus is on the bottom line of their ledgers are more than willing to hunt the dangerous creatures-or, even better, hire out the task to naive adventurers.</p>",

Their inscrutability is a boon to one of their most significant interests-mercantilism- and many haughty witchwyrds openly revel in the befuddlement inspired by their mysterious guises and mannerisms. Witchwyrds have a keen eye for new opportunities and markets, and a witchwyrd almost always knows when someone is trying to pull one over on them.</p>\n<p>These four-armed humanoid creatures have hairless blue-gray skin, are typically 6-1/2 feet tall, and weigh 300 pounds. Their hands have three evenly sized and spaced digits in a tripod-like arrangement. When not trying to blend in with the local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-fitting clothes in bright reds or yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the lands they visit-perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. This, however, is the only indicator; witchwyrds are notoriously close-mouthed about details of this distant world, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked, many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars have theorized a connection between witchwyrds and several other four-armed creatures, but like with questions of their place of origin, witchwyrds have little to say about the topic.</p>",
