The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weatherâ€”weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

Some ardandes say life in Nodollin is filled with infantilization and belittlement from the kizidhars, the wood genies who rule the land and much of the plane. The kizidhars largely view ardandes as genies like them, but a lesser form of genie that ranks below kizidhar commoners in the same way they are lesser to the shuyookhs. Though a few ardandes rebel against this social order, the weight of culture tells them hierarchies are natural to the element of wood, and they should accept their place even if they chafe.</p>\n<p>Many planar ardandes moved to Shodokar when the new city was founded, hoping the influx of portals leading out of the Plane of Wood would let them visit the rest of the multiverse and learn about their lost mortal heritage.

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weatherâ€”weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

Destroying a rival ifrit's brass bastion is a quick way to erode their political status, though anyone caught performing such sabotage faces swift retribution.</p>\n<p>Most brass bastions prominently display the sigil of their owner or maker, though magical methods can also determine who crafted a specific construct. Brass bastions forged by favored artisans are a status symbol in many ifrit communities. Ifrits consider a brass bastion crafted by a non-ifrit to be inherently inferior, barely worth the cost of its materials.

With a head formed of discs that each depict a portion of their face, a capritellix reshapes their personality with a quick whir. Despite their different faces, each capritellix has a unified identity, with one memory and one name. Each mood that cycles through the pieces of their face is a massively amplified facet of their personality, rather than a completely different individual. The differences are subtle to most observers, but a capritellix can display numerous mood combinationsâ€”typically 64 for one with four faces per disc or 125 for one with five faces per disc. No matter how much they change their face, however, capritellixes can't suppress their haughty ego or shake the ceaseless despair they feel. The conflicting priorities of each mood within a capritellix make it difficult for any of these creatures to make long-term plans or form solid relationships. What one face builds up, another undermines, cursed all the while with full knowledge of the former intentions they will never fulfill and the well-laid plans they will abandon.</p>\n<h2>Recycled Remains</h2>\n<p>When horribly damaged or weary, capritellixes travel to a communal necropolis, much like a fabled elephant graveyard.

A cullitox's hunger for gems will lead it to travel almost anywhere, even through planar tears. Occasionally, they even establish colonies on planes other than their own, should their newfound territory prove filled with crystals.</p>\n<p>A cullitox's scorpion-like body glitters with crystal. As light refracts between the facets, they concentrate and absorb it, energizing the cullitox and, some say, fueling the creature's magic.</p>\n<p>Cullitoxes form small communities in locations where crystals are plentiful, working alongside one another to track down anything from a common quartz to precious rubies and sapphires. Scouting parties use their innate magic to communicate with each other via light and wordless sound, as well as to seek out more crystals. However, when precious stone resources grow scarce, cullitoxes become independent and territorial about their supply, taking crystals from wherever they can, even seizing them from other creatures.</p>\n<p>A cullitox's drive to gather crystals is akin to the drive to reproduce. As a cullitox gathers stones, it stores them within its body. Once the cullitox has enough stored material, the parent fuses its stores into a tiny replica of itself and extrudes the infant cullitox, sometimes referred to as a shardling, into the world. The process leaves the parent weakened for a short time, until it can gather enough crystal to repair its body and begin the process anew. Infant cullitoxes consume crystals in a similar way. They process the raw material over a few months to grow to adult size. Thereafter, a cullitox \"eats\" stone only to heal injuries.</p>\n<h2>Internal Gems</h2>\n<p>When a cullitox dies, its body breaks into fragments of crystal. Some of these pieces are valuable, but potentially more lucrative are the gems the cullitox has stored inside its body to produce offspring. It takes semiprecious and precious stones worth 500 gp to produce an infant cullitox, though most slain cullitoxes have only a fraction of this amount stored. Once the stones become a new cullitox, they transform into the crystal of the infant's body, no longer the treasured material they once were.</p>",

The life-giving water that flows across Golarion, the maintenance of healthy forests, and the snows, thaws, and rains that help crops flourish all rely on the weatherâ€”weather that's shaped at the whims of the winds. Anemoi are powerful beings from the Plane of Air tasked by ancient gods to guard the skies and shepherd the winds of every world across the planes. They guide the winds along their natural paths, and while neither malevolent nor malicious, an anemos has little regard for how a storm might affect any creature caught in its path.</p>\n<p>Anemoi can take several forms and shift between them as easily as they slip between the breezes. They wear humanoid guises to walk among mortals without drawing undue attention, and they transform into great, thunderous horses made of storm clouds and rain when they need to move quickly across the skies. Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east. Finally, the gentle winds of spring come at the call of Zephyr, from the west. These four cardinal anemoi, alongside their councils of lesser anemoi, shape and control the winds across all of Golarion. As far as anyone can tell, the cardinal anemoi don't answer to a greater authority. There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",

At rest, a living grove resembles nothing so much as a small arboretum of birch and aspen trees, though oak and redwood varieties that are significantly larger and tougher exist as well.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>At first glance, wood elementals might not seem to have the same destructive potential as their cousins from the Planes of Fire, Water, or Air, but don't be fooled. The woods can be a dangerous place.</p>\n<p>Though some resemble animals, the elemental beasts presented here are still plants, and their life cycles reflect it. Vegetable lambs grow on rooted stalks, from which they can't be removed until they've matured (or perhaps ripened), leaving them dependent on their immediate surroundings for food. Moss sloths are little more than lumps of green fluff for the first century of their existence, only gaining limited mobility once they can grow their defensive wooden claws.</p>\n<h2>Wild But Unwild</h2>\n<p>Many wood elementals are created by kizidhars and other powerful creatures on the Plane of Wood and placed in rote roles. Populating nature preserves and sprawling estates, they can be unsure how to behave if released into the wild. They're essentially born domesticated and will likely act far differently than the wild creatures they mimic, even in natural environments. Their natural predators are few, putting the elementals at less risk, although they're still sometimes eaten by giant termites or captured by some as pets.</p>\n<h2>A Brain By Any Other Name</h2>\n<p>Even if Lady Shumunue taught the wood elementals' ancestors to mimic animals, a wood elemental's consciousness is contained not in a brain but in its root system. Entities like nursery crawlers, living groves, and carved beasts use this to their advantage. That an elemental's wooden body can be carved and crafted, apparently without lasting harm, implies that they might not feel pain so long as their roots remain undamaged.</p>",

The lomori shapes the mound as it grows, creating protective layers to guard their core and forming other useful appendages.

The predator's eyes scan the area, shimmering in the smoke like glowing dots. Wriggling insectoid legsâ€”varying in number from one rakkatak to anotherâ€”hang from its bulbous body. These limbs flail chaotically as a rakkatak fights, only calming when it's time to eat or rest.</p>\n<p>Most rakkataks fly alone, picking off meals in sudden swooping strikes, but they will occasionally form a flock. Despite having little faculty for communication with other creatures, rakkataks have a certain ravenous genius for hunting with kin. Typically, once one grabs prey, the others swoop in to latch on as well, ingesting their meal with leech-like mouths.</p>\n<p>Rakkataks possess insatiable appetites to help them withstand the long periods of famine between their infrequent meals as they travel the expanses of the Plane of Fire. As a result, they easily overconsume if brought somewhere with more abundant fauna, like the Universe. A single rakkatak can hold a surprising quantity of offal, even growing in size as its body expands. It becomes more unwieldy the larger it gets, which planar biologists believe to be a survival tactic to keep a rakkatak from indulging its hunger until it quite literally bursts.</p>\n<h2>Ashen Hunting Grounds</h2>\n<p>Avoiding the blazing chaos and ifrit rule that typify much of the Plane of Fire, rakkataks prefer ashen wastelands as their hunting grounds. They dig simple burrows just barely below the surface, called rakkatak hills. Within, they can doze and digest in peace or lay and tend their horrifying eggs.</p>",

Many taloses mold their natural talent for metalwork into careers as tinkerers, miners, or smiths, although just as many leverage the luster of precious metals in a quest for fame and fortune.</p>\n<p>Taloses are among the most metropolitan of geniekin, often born in or drawn to cities of various sizes, especially those with advanced metalworking or technology trades. Metal often needs to be worked to find its form and function, which may explain why many taloses seem to enjoy living among people, if not necessarily socializing with them. They often find themselves stumbling into jobs somewhere along the production line of technology, whether it's mining the raw ore from the earth, working it into wires and gears, or constructing the devices themselves. Some taloses resent and reject the expectations that they fill such roles, but many embrace their fascination with tech, often going on to become expert inventors. Taloses are therefore far more likely than other geniekin to make use of clockwork technology in their communities.</p>\n<p>Despite having long inhabited Golarion, albeit in small numbers, taloses have only rarely been recognized as geniekin. The largest number of them, and also the largest number whose true nature is known, inhabit Tian Xia. The traditions of metal as an element have lived much longer there. Taloses often find themselves drawn to discussions and study of elemental metal the instant they hear of the concept. Historical records speak of renowned courtiers and diplomats with skin of flawless silver or bronze. In the Ivory Port of Goka, the smiths of the family-owned Dragon's Iron Forge craft their blades and firearms with magnetic techniques handed down from their zuhra sheikha ancestor.</p>\n<p>A talos gadgeteer is a clockwork tinkerer.

With a crab's foreclaws, turtle's shell, and back flippers, tantriogs are among the more unique water elementals. They ply the Boundless Sea constantly seeking new experiences, whether the next big wave to ride, a tasty delicacy to sample, or a piece of art to collect. They crave new sensations and often seek them out at the expense of others.</p>\n<p>If one possesses rare art, lost lore, or fantastic surfing or cooking skills, a tantriog can be a wonderful companion. They're charming and friendly to those they find interesting, but their interest can be highly precarious, dropped the second someone bores them. Tantriogs may even betray acquaintances if it would give them another interesting story to tell. This makes befriending one a tricky proposition, as nothing can be taken for granted.</p>\n<p>It's a mystery how tantriogs came to wear their current forms. Some say that, in the earliest days of the elemental planes, tantriogs were assassins of ice and mist who committed a crime so great that they're being punished for it to this day. Others claim tantriogs assumed their shape after losing a bizarre cosmic bet. One of the more popular theories about the tantriog's current form is that in the past, they used to be able to shift shape as easily as water molds to its container. In their endless boredom, they were trying out a variety of shapes when a sudden curse (possibly cast by faydhaans) caused them to lose their ability while transforming from a turtle to a crab, leaving them stuck between the two. It's said that any who can teach a tantriog how to relearn their morphing ability could earn the elemental's undying friendship. Whatever the case, the surest way to anger a tantriog is to ask them about their appearance.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the surest way to befriend a tantriog is with compliments about their appearance or their skills. Don't be too fawning, though. Tantriogs don't like being tricked or made to look a fool.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>IMPRESSING A TANTRIOG</p>\n<p>A tantriog loves seeing a new sight or impressive exhibition of skill. Anyone who wants to stay in a tantriog's good graces needs to keep the new experiences flowing. For this reason, many tantriogs have formed unlikely friendships with gnomes, whose need to seek out new experiences provides common ground.</p>",

She created 65,536, all in her own image, and all imbued with a piece of her divine spark. During her imprisonment, Ayrzul used visions of a future extinction to manipulate them into sacrificing their power to him. This sacrifice split xiomorns into two classes: 32,768 vault builders who kept Sairazul's essence and 32,768 vault keepers who would live forever no longer. For millennia, xiomorns built a vast, magical civilization across the Plane of Earth, and when there was no space left to build, they left. On each new world, xiomorns build their vaults and conduct their experiments, endlessly searching for clues to help them avoid their extinction.</p>\n<h2>Vault Seeds</h2>\n<p>Xiomorns create magical underground caverns using vault seeds, ancient magical tools bequeathed to their species by Ayrzul as a reward for their sacrifice. The vault seeds were used to create the Vaults of Orv in Golarion's Darklands, and an accident involving an out-of-control vault seed created the mysterious Emerald Spire.</p>\n<h2>Crystal Crafters</h2>\n<p>Xiomorns have mastered the creation of numerous magic items made of crystal beyond generation stones and vault seeds. These include pillars of black stone called whisperstones that allow xiomorns to communicate telepathically across vaults, orvgates that use weblike funnels of green crystal to allow teleportation between Darklands vaults, and a vortex in Orv called the Crystal Womb that connects to a crucial stronghold on the Plane of Earth.</p>",

There, they extend their tongues to trap unwary flying insects or adventurers who might happen to float by. Their multiple eyes keep watch for their next meal even while devouring current prey.</p>\n<p>The intense cold of a veldenar's stomach rapidly incapacitates its victims, allowing the predator to focus on returning to invisibility and finding a secluded spot to digest. Victims who escape the veldenar's stomach often feel chilled to the bone for days.</p>\n<p>Veldenars aren't discerning about who or what they inhale. As a result, kinds of scrap can collect in their stomachs, especially inorganic material.

Their true form, however, is wind coalesced into a humanoid shape, often with curling hair and feathery wings made of soft, drifting clouds.</p>\n<p>On Golarion, each of the four cardinal winds are created and directed by a quartet of cardinal anemoi. The cold north winds are guided by Boreal, bringer of winter. Austral shepherds hot winds from the south. Eural brings stormy winds from the east.

There are even more powerful maximal anemoi living in the Plane of Air, but they seem content to leave the Universe out of their plans.</p>\n<p>Though the cardinal anemoi try to keep a degree of separation from mortal affairs, lesser anemoi occasionally take a closer interest. Some monitor a single settlement or county, protecting, nourishing, or even vindictively destroying it. Each one has their own sets of interests. Many are vain or petty. Even more change attitudes just as quickly as the winds they guide. Pleasing an anemoi isn't a matter of following a set formula, but rather repeatedly changing course to give them what they desire for their mercurial current interests or perceived needs.</p>\n<h2>The Shape Of The Air</h2>\n<p>Anemoi on the Plane of Air are typically genderless, while those who spend time in the Universe sometimes experiment with or develop preferences for one of the genders of the mortals they watch or live close to.</p>",
